# Tasks: Resolve open assurance issues

## Policy execution coverage

- [x] [serial] Add typed policy execution status, ownership, scope, checker, evidence identity, and diagnostic linkage to the standards report. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.policy_execution]
- [x] [serial] Map local checker coverage explicitly and classify unimplemented local, external, and human policies truthfully. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.policy_execution]
- [x] [parallel] Add checker-failure input, `tool_error`, `not_applicable`, and strict coverage exit behavior. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.policy_execution]
- [x] [parallel] Cover the timeout/serial gap, passing, failed, missing execution, family exclusion, and external/human cases. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.policy_execution]

## Negative controls

- [x] [serial] Add v2 typed verifier evidence, mutation identity, measured source/deck identities, and outcome distinctions. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.negative_control]
- [x] [parallel] Require a passing baseline and attributed mutant rejection for `property_demonstrated`; keep v1 readable but inconclusive. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.negative_control]
- [x] [parallel] Recompute the negative-control decision during proof-ref validation and detect changed artifacts. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.negative_control]
- [x] [serial] Add positive and negative tests for every acceptance bullet. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.negative_control]

## Requirement contracts and freshness

- [x] [serial] Define the Nickel-authored contract, evidence bundle, and Rust decision DTOs with spec/source/clause/assumption/exclusion identities. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.requirement_contract]
- [x] [parallel] Implement `requirements check`, `verify`, and decision recomputation with fail-closed dispositions and negative controls. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.requirement_contract]
- [x] [parallel] Implement `requirements freshness` over the evidence codebase index with direct bindings, bounded BFS, and incomplete/stale/failed/unsupported outcomes. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.freshness]
- [x] [serial] Add the reviewed Aeneas fixture contract, empirical assumption check, exclusion, and freshness index fixture. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.requirement_contract]
- [x] [serial] Add tests for missing evidence, changed sources/spec/assumptions, empirical-for-formal rejection, duplicate IDs, empty inventory, tampering, and freshness distinctions. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.freshness]

## Executed replay

- [x] [serial] Preserve `--observed` comparison and label it `supplied_observation`. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.executed_replay]
- [x] [parallel] Add closed `check-v1` and `fingerprint-production-v1` profiles with fixed argv, allowlisted environment, limits, isolated output, and expected outputs. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.executed_replay]
- [x] [parallel] Add the versioned execution receipt, drift outcomes, named failure contracts, and input/receipt validation. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.executed_replay]
- [x] [serial] Test launch, fabricated observations, source/config/toolchain/argv/output/exit drift, timeout/overflow, unsupported profiles, path escape, and expected-failure mismatch. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.executed_replay]

## Admission authentication

- [x] [serial] Add pinned artifact-auth path dependencies and consumer-owned policy/evidence DTOs outside the candidate bundle. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.admission_auth]
- [x] [parallel] Verify detached signatures with `verify_and_evaluate` and bind bundle/provenance identities into the canonical scope. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.admission_auth]
- [x] [parallel] Report integrity, signature, authorization, currentness, checker, and overall outcomes separately with a recomputable decision receipt. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.admission_auth]
- [x] [serial] Test authorized success, unknown/unauthorized producers, wrong purpose/scope/subject/generation, threshold, altered bytes, forged observations, and whole-bundle replacement. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.admission_auth]

## Local scanners

- [x] [serial] Add Nickel Semgrep/CodeQL producer profiles and generated JSON with pinned executable, rules/query packs, scope, and limits. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.local_scanners]
- [x] [parallel] Add bounded producer execution, fixed argv, source snapshot, tool/rule identity, CodeQL database sidecar, and execution receipt. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.local_scanners]
- [x] [parallel] Reuse the SARIF importer and distinguish imported from executed evidence; missing tools stay unsupported. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.local_scanners]
- [x] [serial] Test clean/violation, missing/wrong tool, changed rules, source mutation, stale database, failed/empty report, timeout/overflow, exclusions, malformed SARIF, unsupported scope, replacement, and mislabeled import. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.local_scanners]
- [x] [parallel] Retain real Semgrep 1.180.0 and CodeQL 2.27.2 clean and violating reports, accept the `Semgrep OSS` driver spelling, correct the query-pack pin to `0.1.46`, and document the retained fixtures. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.local_scanners]

## Cross-tool benchmark

- [x] [serial] Keep the same-command comparator unchanged and add a separate experiment contract with tasks, applicability, corpus, assurance cases, and adoption targets. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.cross_tool_benchmark]
- [x] [parallel] Add bounded recorded/execute modes, retained observations, comparable-subset metrics, unavailable-tool handling, and source-linked report. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.cross_tool_benchmark]
- [x] [parallel] Verify derived fields from retained inputs and implement the eight negative controls. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.cross_tool_benchmark]
- [x] [serial] Add the compiling corpus, frozen expected outcomes, checked-in artifact/report, and CLI verify surface. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.cross_tool_benchmark]

## Public release cohort

- [x] [serial] Author the Nickel release-cohort manifest and generator with exact public/development source and export identities. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.release_cohort]
- [x] [parallel] Add offline cross-field validation, inventory comparison, notice checks, receipt freshness, and blocked qualification. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.release_cohort]
- [x] [parallel] Add the nine required negative controls and current public inventory/toolchain fixtures. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.release_cohort]
- [x] [serial] Document the supported channel, copyable public install command, walkthrough fix, and explicit blockers. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.release_cohort]

## Verification

- [x] [serial] Run `cargo test -p cargo-octet --lib` and `cargo test -p octet-standards --lib`. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.policy_execution]
- [x] [serial] Run workspace Clippy with `-D warnings` and `cargo fmt --all --check`. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.requirement_contract]
- [x] [serial] Verify Nickel export freshness and registry typecheck for every changed generated artifact. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.release_cohort]
- [x] [serial] Run the requirements check/verify/freshness and benchmark verify CLI surfaces end to end. r[octet.open_issue_resolution.freshness]
