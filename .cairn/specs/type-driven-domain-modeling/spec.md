# Type Driven Domain Modeling Specification

## Purpose

Defines the `type-driven-domain-modeling` capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Domain identities are strongly typed

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.domain_identities] Octet core APIs SHOULD represent stable domain identities with named Rust types instead of raw strings, path buffers, or numeric primitives when those identities cross non-trivial module boundaries or influence diagnostics, evidence, config, or release decisions.

#### Scenario: Raw identity does not cross a migrated core boundary

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.domain_identities.raw_boundary]

- GIVEN a lint name, lint group, diagnostic identity, evidence family, artifact locator, config key, or policy threshold has been migrated to a typed identity
- WHEN a pure core function receives that value
- THEN the function SHOULD accept the domain type rather than a raw `String`, `&str`, `PathBuf`, or primitive numeric value.
- AND adapters SHOULD remain responsible for parsing or formatting public wire and CLI representations.

#### Scenario: Public representation remains compatible

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.domain_identities.public_compatibility]

- GIVEN an existing consumer uses supported config keys, source attributes, emitted evidence fields, SARIF fields, or CLI output parsing
- WHEN Octet introduces internal domain identity types
- THEN user-facing representations MUST remain compatible unless a separate reviewed migration changes that contract.

### Requirement: Algebraic states replace flag bags

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.algebraic_states] Octet SHOULD model mutually exclusive config, diagnostic, evidence, lifecycle, and gate states with enums or equivalent algebraic Rust types rather than independent booleans or open string tags.

#### Scenario: Invalid state combination is unrepresentable

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.algebraic_states.invalid_combinations]

- GIVEN a state can be clean, warning-only, error-level, skipped, unsupported, or manually reviewed
- WHEN the state is represented in a migrated core
- THEN the representation SHOULD prevent contradictory combinations such as clean and error-level at the same time.
- AND tests SHOULD cover both accepted states and rejected malformed inputs at the adapter boundary.

### Requirement: Refined values validate invariants once

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.refined_values] Octet SHOULD use explicit constructors for refined values whose invariants matter to deterministic behavior, including non-empty collections, canonical names, sorted or deduplicated sets, normalized paths, and named threshold or count values.

#### Scenario: Invalid refined input fails before core use

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.refined_values.negative_inputs]

- GIVEN an input collection is empty where non-empty data is required, a name is non-canonical, a path is outside the accepted form, a set contains duplicates, or a threshold/count value is invalid for its domain
- WHEN the adapter constructs the refined value
- THEN construction MUST fail with a deterministic diagnostic naming the rejected invariant.
- AND the pure core MUST NOT receive the invalid value.

#### Scenario: Refined values remain boring Rust

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.refined_values.boring_rust]

- GIVEN a refined value is added to Octet
- WHEN reviewers inspect its API
- THEN the API SHOULD use explicit Rust constructors, accessors, and pattern matching.
- AND it SHOULD NOT require lens-heavy access, monad terminology, lazy-evaluation assumptions, or type-level machinery unless the design names the concrete bug class prevented.

### Requirement: Domain-type migration is incremental

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.incremental_migration] Domain-type adoption MUST be incremental and reviewable, with each migration naming the core seam, compatibility adapters, positive tests, negative tests, and user-visible non-changes.

#### Scenario: Compatibility adapters are tested

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.incremental_migration.compatibility]

- GIVEN a domain type replaces a raw value inside an Octet core
- WHEN existing Dylint config, source attributes, emitted evidence, SARIF output, artifact manifests, or CLI output pass through the boundary
- THEN adapters MUST preserve accepted inputs and outputs.
- AND malformed inputs MUST fail at the adapter with deterministic diagnostics rather than panicking in the core.

### Requirement: Nominal domain policy is typed

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.nominal_policy] Octet MUST define a Nickel-authored policy for enforced nominal domains. Each domain MUST declare its raw representation, core scopes, compatibility scopes, wrapper kind, and constructor policy.

#### Scenario: Declared nominal policy is accepted

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.nominal_policy.accepted]
- GIVEN a policy declares unique domains, supported raw representations, bounded core scopes, explicit compatibility scopes, and valid constructor rules
- WHEN Octet exports and loads the policy
- THEN the generated runtime data MUST be deterministic
- AND the checker MUST apply the declared scope without ambient repository discovery.

#### Scenario: Invalid nominal policy fails closed

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.nominal_policy.fixtures]
- GIVEN a policy has duplicate domains, unknown representations, unsafe overlapping scopes, missing required exceptions, or invalid constructor rules
- WHEN policy export or checker startup runs
- THEN Octet MUST fail with deterministic policy diagnostics
- AND it MUST NOT continue with partial nominal enforcement.

### Requirement: Primitive domain aliases are reported

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.primitive_alias] Octet MUST report a declared core domain whose type alias resolves directly to its configured raw representation.

#### Scenario: Primitive domain alias is rejected

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.primitive_alias.raw]
- GIVEN `UnitId` is a declared string-backed domain in a checked core scope
- WHEN the source declares `type UnitId = String`
- THEN `primitive_domain_alias` MUST report the alias with the configured domain identity.

#### Scenario: Generic nominal alias is accepted

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.primitive_alias.nominal]
- GIVEN `UnitId` aliases a nominal generic instantiation such as `DomainId<UnitRole>`
- WHEN resolved-type matching runs
- THEN Octet MUST NOT classify the alias as a primitive alias.

### Requirement: Raw domain values are excluded from core APIs

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.raw_domain_value] Octet MUST report configured raw domain representations in declared core fields, parameters, results, enum payloads, and map keys unless an explicit compatibility scope applies.

#### Scenario: Raw core value is rejected

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.raw_domain_value.core]
- GIVEN a declared `SourceId` domain uses `String` as its wire representation
- WHEN a checked core API exposes `source_id: String`
- THEN `raw_domain_value` MUST report the raw core boundary.

#### Scenario: Compatibility DTO remains accepted

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.compatibility_exceptions]
- GIVEN a declared wire, FFI, generated, vendored, or protocol DTO scope uses the required raw representation
- WHEN nominal enforcement checks that scope
- THEN the hard finding MUST be suppressed
- AND the policy MUST identify the adapter boundary into typed core data.

### Requirement: Refined wrappers prevent unchecked construction

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.wrapper_contract] Refined domains in enforced scope MUST keep invariant-bearing inner fields private and MUST use fallible construction from untrusted primitive input.

#### Scenario: Refined wrapper bypass is rejected

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.wrapper_contract.bypass]
- GIVEN a refined digest, path, token, secret, or bounded identifier has a public inner field or unrestricted primitive `From` conversion
- WHEN `newtype_invariant_bypass` checks the wrapper
- THEN Octet MUST report the unchecked construction path.

#### Scenario: Explicit checked wrapper passes

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.wrapper_contract.checked]
- GIVEN a refined wrapper has a private field, fallible parser or `TryFrom` conversion, and explicit borrowed accessors
- WHEN wrapper checking runs
- THEN Octet MUST accept the wrapper shape.

### Requirement: Symptom lints recognize owned semantic primitives

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.symptom_lints] `ambiguous_params` and `numeric_units` MUST recognize configured owned primitive-like types, associated functions, methods, parameters, and fields without reporting values whose resolved nominal type already carries the distinction.

#### Scenario: Repeated raw API values are reported

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.symptom_lints.raw]
- GIVEN a public constructor accepts repeated `String` or path values that can be exchanged without a compiler error
- WHEN `ambiguous_params` checks the signature
- THEN it MUST report the exchangeable raw parameters.

#### Scenario: Typed units suppress naming findings

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.symptom_lints.typed]
- GIVEN a field or parameter uses a configured duration or byte-count newtype
- WHEN `numeric_units` checks its name
- THEN it MUST accept the type-carried unit without requiring a duplicate suffix.

### Requirement: Compile-time role separation has fixture evidence

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.compile_time_separation] Octet MUST include compile-pass and compile-fail fixtures proving that configured marker-domain aliases accept same-domain values and reject cross-domain substitution.

#### Scenario: Cross-domain substitution does not compile

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.compile_time_separation.negative]
- GIVEN `UnitId` and `SourceId` use distinct marker instantiations over the same representation
- WHEN a fixture passes `SourceId` to an API that requires `UnitId`
- THEN the fixture MUST fail compilation for a type mismatch.

### Requirement: Nominal enforcement is promoted in stages

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.staged_promotion] Octet MUST separate heuristic inventory from exact-policy enforcement and MUST require positive, negative, and compatibility evidence before adding nominal checks to a strict profile.

#### Scenario: Heuristics do not become hard policy

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.staged_promotion.heuristics]
- GIVEN an unregistered field name matches an identity, digest, token, path, unit, or revision suffix
- WHEN inventory mode runs
- THEN Octet CAN report a review candidate
- AND strict-profile denial MUST NOT use that heuristic without an exact policy row.

#### Scenario: Strict promotion uses reviewed evidence

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.staged_promotion.evidence]
- GIVEN fixture and pilot evidence demonstrates accepted core types, rejected category errors, and valid compatibility exceptions
- WHEN maintainers promote a nominal check
- THEN the strict profile MUST bind the reviewed policy and evidence identity.

### Requirement: Nominal enforcement claims remain bounded

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.docs] Octet documentation and diagnostics MUST state that nominal checks prove configured source-shape conformance only.

#### Scenario: Enforcement claim remains bounded

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.final_checks]
- GIVEN nominal checks pass for a selected scope
- WHEN Octet reports the result
- THEN it MUST NOT claim runtime correctness, authority, secrecy, evidence truth, compiler correctness, or release eligibility.

### Requirement: Molten reference adoption is exact and producer-owned

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.molten_adoption.catalog] Octet MUST register
the 15 `molten.nominal-reference.*` domains and their alias/qualified-field
mapping documented in `docs/type-driven-domain-modeling.md` in the existing
central Nickel catalog. Rows MUST use raw `string`, `marker-generic`, and
`private-fallible`, the exact Molten core file, and required explicit wire
compatibility. Runtime policy MUST remain the source-owned embedded export.
Both Nickel and Rust admission MUST accept the checked generic constructor pair,
retain marker-only support, and reject marker-generic/private-infallible.

#### Scenario: Exact Molten catalog

- GIVEN the 15 reviewed alias and field mappings
- WHEN the producer generates the nominal catalog
- THEN the generated export MUST preserve exact physical source selectors
- AND it MUST NOT replace them with logical migration labels or broad prefixes.
- AND checked generic construction MUST be admitted without admitting unchecked
  generic construction or claiming generic constructor semantic validation.

### Requirement: Local macro aliases enforce configured primitive denial

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.molten_adoption.macros] For local macro aliases,
Octet MUST use the compiler-resolved type and the real user callsite to enforce
exact configured core alias policy. Compatibility MUST remain admitted;
heuristic-only names and external macro expansions MUST remain excluded.

#### Scenario: Local macro String regression

- GIVEN an exact registered alias emitted by Molten's unchanged local domain macro
- WHEN its resolved type changes from a nominal generic wrapper to String
- THEN deny-mode checking MUST fail at the configured core user callsite
- AND compiler UI and real consumer mutation evidence MUST identify that alias.

#### Scenario: Direct core String regression

- GIVEN a registered core struct field from any of the 15 domains
- WHEN it contains String directly or through supported Option storage
- THEN deny-mode checking MUST fail rather than admitting primitive core storage.

### Requirement: Compatibility and evidence limits remain explicit

r[octet.type_driven_domain_modeling.molten_adoption.compatibility] Octet MUST admit
nominal generic aliases/core fields and explicit raw wire-compatible shapes.
Checks MUST NOT imply borrowed primitive traversal, generic constructor validity,
whole-consumer migration, authority, runtime correctness, or release eligibility.
Consumer pins MUST identify an approved immutable available provider cohort.

#### Scenario: Nominal generic compatibility

- GIVEN typed local macro aliases and registered fields or raw shapes in declared compatibility
- WHEN deny-mode compiler UI checks run
- THEN those shapes MUST have no nominal-domain diagnostics.

#### Scenario: Scope and non-claims

- GIVEN only local unpublished provider changes and source-shape evidence
- WHEN consumer integration readiness is assessed
- THEN no accepted immutable-pin, sync/archive, runtime, or release claim is justified.
