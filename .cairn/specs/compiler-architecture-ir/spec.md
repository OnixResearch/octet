# Compiler Architecture Ir Specification

## Purpose

Defines the `compiler-architecture-ir` capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Compiler architecture collection follows project activation

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.activation]

Octet MUST collect compiler architecture facts only for a valid active project architecture policy.

#### Scenario: Active policy starts collection

- GIVEN a project selects a valid architecture policy and declared production targets
- WHEN `cargo octet check` invokes Cargo
- THEN the runner MUST activate compiler fact collection for the selected compilation units

#### Scenario: No policy leaves compilation unchanged

- GIVEN a project has no architecture-policy pointer
- WHEN `cargo octet check` invokes Cargo
- THEN Octet MUST NOT create architecture shard directories, collector environment, Architecture IR, or coverage artifacts

### Requirement: Architecture IR schemas are Rust-owned

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.schema]

Octet MUST define versioned Rust DTOs for compiler fact shards, normalized Architecture IR, collection coverage, diagnostics, and receipt metadata.

#### Scenario: Generated contract is current

- GIVEN the Rust DTO schema is current
- WHEN contract generation and freshness validation run
- THEN the generated Nickel contract MUST match the Rust-owned schema
- AND the receipt-family registry MUST classify the output as Rust-derived

#### Scenario: Shard schema is malformed

- GIVEN a shard has an unknown schema, missing identity, invalid reference, invalid bound, or malformed span
- WHEN pure normalization runs
- THEN normalization MUST reject the shard with a deterministic diagnostic

### Requirement: Compiler facts cover architecture semantics

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.facts]

Each selected compilation-unit shard MUST record bounded compiler facts for roles, items, types, traits, implementations, signatures, calls, constructors, effects, expansions, and active configuration.

#### Scenario: Resolved architecture facts are emitted

- GIVEN rustc resolves a public signature, trait implementation, constructor type, call definition, macro origin, or direct effect primitive
- WHEN the collector evaluates the unit
- THEN the shard MUST record the resolved definition origin, source span, active target, feature set, and fact kind
- AND workspace source paths MUST be normalized and workspace-relative
- AND external generated sources MUST use typed BLAKE3 provenance without a workspace path

#### Scenario: Source text mimics a declaration

- GIVEN a comment, string, inactive configuration branch, or unresolved source spelling contains an expected trait or implementation name
- WHEN the collector runs
- THEN that spelling MUST NOT satisfy a compiler-fact obligation

### Requirement: Architecture identities are canonical and content-bound

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.identity]

Durable Architecture IR identities MUST use domain-separated BLAKE3 framing over canonical project, policy, package, target, item, signature, and source facts.

#### Scenario: Unchanged inputs repeat

- GIVEN policy, source, Cargo graph, features, target, toolchain, and compiler facts are unchanged
- WHEN collection and normalization run twice
- THEN shard identities, normalized ordering, coverage, and final Architecture IR identity MUST match

#### Scenario: Compiler-local index changes

- GIVEN a rustc-local HIR, MIR, or definition index changes while canonical semantic and source facts remain equal
- WHEN durable identities are computed
- THEN the local index MUST NOT become part of the durable identity

### Requirement: Collection coverage is complete

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.coverage]

Octet MUST compare expected production compilation units with valid observed compiler shards before it emits complete Architecture IR.

#### Scenario: Every expected unit is observed

- GIVEN locked Cargo metadata, policy targets, exact invocation, and valid shards identify the same complete unit set
- WHEN coverage evaluation runs
- THEN coverage MUST report complete with every expected and observed unit identity

#### Scenario: Unit is missing or mismatched

- GIVEN an expected target emits no shard or a shard has a stale package, target, feature, source, policy, toolchain, or collector identity
- WHEN coverage evaluation runs
- THEN collection MUST fail with a deterministic incomplete-coverage diagnostic

### Requirement: Unsupported compiler facts remain explicit

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.unknowns]

The collector MUST emit typed unknown records for ambiguous dispatch, unsupported expansion, opaque generated code, missing bodies, FFI, and unsupported compiler shapes.

#### Scenario: Dynamic dispatch is unresolved

- GIVEN a selected call uses trait-object or other dynamic dispatch that the collector cannot resolve exactly
- WHEN collection runs
- THEN the caller MUST receive a typed unknown call fact with its source and target identity

#### Scenario: Unknown fact reaches normalization

- GIVEN a valid shard contains an unknown fact
- WHEN normalization runs
- THEN the unknown fact MUST remain in canonical output
- AND normalization MUST NOT infer a clean or effect-free fact

### Requirement: Compiler collection is bounded and scoped

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.boundary]

The project policy MUST define named limits for units, shards, items, types, traits, implementations, calls, effects, unknowns, spans, and artifact bytes.

#### Scenario: Collection stays within limits

- GIVEN every fact count and byte size is within policy limits
- WHEN collection completes
- THEN the result MAY emit canonical Architecture IR with explicit non-claims

#### Scenario: A limit is exceeded

- GIVEN a collector or normalizer exceeds one declared limit
- WHEN the limit is detected
- THEN collection MUST stop or truncate only as declared
- AND the result MUST be incomplete and MUST NOT support a gate-clean claim

### Requirement: Compiler fact decisions use a functional core

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.functional_core]

Shard validation, identity calculation, normalization, coverage, and diagnostic ordering MUST operate over explicit in-memory values.

#### Scenario: Normalizer runs without compiler effects

- GIVEN policy, expected-unit, and shard values are supplied directly
- WHEN normalizer tests run
- THEN they MUST not require filesystem access, environment values, Cargo, rustc processes, clocks, randomness, or output sinks

#### Scenario: Shell owns collection effects

- GIVEN the runner invokes Cargo, coordinates shards, reads files, or writes artifacts
- WHEN reviewers inspect the implementation
- THEN those effects MUST remain in the cargo-octet or rustc-adapter shell

### Requirement: Compiler IR verification is adversarial

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.verification]

The implementation MUST include positive and negative fixtures for compiler semantics, identity, unknowns, bounds, coverage, activation, and deterministic replay.

#### Scenario: Adversarial fixture matrix runs

- GIVEN fixtures include aliases, comments, macros, inactive code, generic signatures, trait implementations, indirect factories, dynamic dispatch, missing units, stale shards, and malformed facts
- WHEN focused collector validation runs
- THEN positive fixtures MUST emit expected canonical facts
- AND negative fixtures MUST fail with their declared diagnostic class

### Requirement: Normalized facts retain compilation-unit membership
r[octet.architecture.unit_membership]

Normalized Architecture IR MUST retain every validated unit's fact and unknown memberships before deduplication.
Membership MUST be canonical, required, covered by the IR identity, and checked against all declared units, facts, and unknowns.
Missing or noncanonical unit rows, duplicate or unsorted member IDs, orphan IDs, and subjects without any membership MUST fail verification.
Recomputing the enclosing identity MUST NOT change that rejection.
A change to any shared membership edge MUST change that identity. Structural verification MUST NOT claim to authenticate a structurally possible resealed relation.
A v1 IR without memberships MUST NOT acquire invented ownership.

#### Scenario: Shared facts retain both observing units

- GIVEN two complete validated shards that share facts and unknowns
- WHEN normalization deduplicates those values
- THEN both unit memberships MUST remain and output MUST be invariant under shard ordering

#### Scenario: Malformed membership is resealed

- GIVEN a normalized IR with a missing unit row, noncanonical row or member order, duplicate or orphan IDs, or an unreferenced subject
- WHEN its enclosing identity is recomputed and verification runs
- THEN verification MUST reject the malformed relation

#### Scenario: Legacy or incomplete evidence is supplied

- GIVEN legacy IR without memberships or a missing selected compiler shard
- WHEN decoding or normalization runs
- THEN the input MUST remain unsupported or incomplete without ownership fallback

### Requirement: Caller identities preserve compiler body kinds

r[octet.compiler_architecture_ir.body_owner_kinds]

The collector MUST preserve the compiler definition kind when it discovers a call's body owner.
It MUST request a function signature only for a function kind.
Inline and anonymous constant owners MUST retain constant item identities and their observations, without function signatures.
Lazy discovery MUST use the same item classification as existing local identity calculation.
Expression body owners MUST retain private visibility without a named-item visibility query.

#### Scenario: Constant and static bodies contain calls

- GIVEN named, associated, inline, anonymous, or macro-generated constants and static initializers contain resolved calls
- WHEN the selected compiler collects those calls
- THEN every call MUST reference an item with the matching compiler kind
- AND non-function owners MUST NOT acquire function signatures or disappear from the observation set

#### Scenario: Functions and closures coexist with constants

- GIVEN functions, methods, closures, and constant bodies share selected production units
- WHEN collection and normalization run
- THEN ordinary function signatures and existing closure handling MUST remain intact
- AND item references, unit memberships, and coverage MUST remain valid

#### Scenario: Expanded state contains a forbidden production effect

- GIVEN a thread-local initializer contains an inline constant and a nested production body contains a filesystem operation
- WHEN the compiler collector and project gate run
- THEN collection MUST NOT crash on a function-signature query for the constant
- AND the production effect MUST remain visible and rejected in each observing production unit
- AND omitted compiler shards MUST still reject complete-coverage claims
