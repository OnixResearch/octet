## Contract

- [ ] [serial] Specify that Octet supports multiple independent tiny production Verus pilot rails, each with unique scope, receipt identity, and non-claim wording. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]

## Implementation

- [ ] [serial] Choose and add a second tiny pure `src/verified/` target whose property can be reviewed without broad Octet runtime dependencies. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Add a matching Verus proof file under `verus/proofs/` and confirm direct `octet-production-verus` success. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Add a distinct production proof rail with unique policy ID, receipt path, checked scope, source/proof bindings, pass signal, and trust boundary. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Register policy and config/receipt family impacts in `standards/policies/registry.ncl` and keep generated/freshness checks aligned. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Update README, consumer guide, and `verus/README.md` to describe multiple tiny production pilots without claiming whole-program correctness. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]

## Verification

- [ ] [serial] Add positive tests showing both production pilot receipts validate independently and emit scoped `formal_proof` provenance for their own artifact identities. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Add negative tests showing a stale or swapped second-pilot source/proof binding fails without invalidating the first pilot's diagnostic clarity. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Run manifest, policy-registry, multi-rail `cargo octet prove`, `artifact verify`, and focused proof tests after implementation. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Confirm the negative production proof change remains green before archive. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
- [ ] [serial] Run Cairn validation and gates for this change package before implementation and before archive. r[octet.verus_proof_rails.production_pilot_expansion]
