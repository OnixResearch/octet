# Strict Rust profiles

Octet strict profiles are opt-in, versioned policy selections for ordinary Rust. A selected profile activates a reviewed deny-level lint floor, raises function-address checking to a declared minimum, and binds the profile into the existing BLAKE3 run evidence.

A passing profile means that the configured Octet source-shape checks passed for the recorded scope and toolchain. It is not a new Rust language, a transitive effect system, a resolved call-graph proof, formal verification, dependency-closure certification, or release eligibility.

## Profiles

| Profile | Intended use | Required core scopes | Function-address floor | Default address scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `robust` | Explicit failure, checked conversion/arithmetic, unsafe public API review, TODO rejection, and suppression governance | no | `observe` | workspace |
| `bounded-systems` | `robust` plus bounded resources, platform-width boundaries, and exact nominal-domain policy | no | `warn` | workspace |
| `deterministic-core` | `robust` plus declared core effects, deterministic output, and exact nominal-domain policy | yes | `deny` | `core_source_scopes` |

The profiles form a lattice rather than one universal safety score. `bounded-systems` and `deterministic-core` both extend `robust`, but they make different claims about different source scopes.

The Nickel source of truth is [`standards/strict-profiles/profiles.ncl`](../standards/strict-profiles/profiles.ncl). Runtime Rust consumes the checked-in generated JSON. The catalog rejects an unknown required lint.

`bounded-systems` and `deterministic-core` deny exact nominal-domain findings. They never deny suffix-based discovery candidates. The selected profile sets nominal-domain mode to `deny`, also over a consumer `nominal_domain_mode = "inventory"`, so the inventory mode's warning about capping `lint_levels` denies at `warn` is not printed under these profiles.

## Run a profile

```bash
cargo octet check --profile robust --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
```

A selected profile is authoritative for its required lint set. If consumer `dylint.toml` disables a required lint or assigns it `allow` or `warn`, Octet strengthens the effective level to `deny`. The profile denies are applied after command-line lint options, so `-A` or `-W` flags in `DYLINT_RUSTFLAGS` cannot weaken them either. rustc would still let `--force-warn` or a `--cap-lints` below `deny` override a later deny, so a profiled compilation fails with an error that names the flag when `--cap-lints allow|warn|force-warn` is set or when a `--force-warn` names a required lint directly, through its bare alias, or through a lint group that contains it. Unrelated thresholds, allowlists, disabled lints, and levels remain consumer-owned; explicit command-line levels win over consumer `lint_levels`.

Source-level Rust suppressions remain possible. Profiles include Octet's suppression-governance lints, so an escape hatch remains an explicit source diff with the existing justification requirements: `unjustified_allow` denies an `allow` or `expect` of a Clippy lint, an Octet lint or group (`tigerstyle::...`), or an Octet bare alias such as `no_unwrap` unless a non-doc `//` comment on or directly above the attribute, or a non-empty `reason = "..."`, explains it, and `unjustified_no_todo_allow` audits `no_todo` allows. Under a profile a source `warn` that reaches one of the profile's required lints, such as `#![warn(no_unwrap)]`, `#[warn(tigerstyle::no_unwrap)]`, or a `tigerstyle::` group with a required member, lowers that lint from `deny` and needs the same justification. A `warn` that only raises lints the profile does not require, such as `#![warn(function_length)]`, stays unaffected, and without a profile `warn` is never governed. rustc has no `force_warn` source attribute, so `--force-warn` is handled as a command-line weakening above. Profiles do not add a silent assume mechanism.

The governance lints themselves cannot be suppressed under a profile. rustc applies an attribute's lint levels before a lint inspects that attribute, so `#![allow(tigerstyle::structure)]` or `#[allow(unjustified_allow)]` would otherwise switch the audit off for the whole subtree. With a profile selected, Octet therefore rejects with a compile error any source `allow`, `expect`, or `warn` that you write naming `unjustified_allow` or `unjustified_no_todo_allow`, by bare name, by `tigerstyle::` name, or through the Octet group that contains it (`tigerstyle::structure`, `tigerstyle::safety`). A justification comment or `reason` does not make it legal, so such an attribute gets only this error and no `unjustified_allow` finding asking for a justification. The error is a compiler-session error, not a lint, so no lint level can silence it. The governance lints stay at `deny`, and nothing else is forbidden crate-wide: a raised level such as `#![deny(unjustified_allow)]`, a justified allow of an ordinary floor lint such as `no_unwrap`, your own group forbids, and attributes that another crate's macro or derive generates are unaffected.

Both checks look at the whole attribute list of an item, as rustc does: a lint that a later `deny` or `forbid` on the same node raises back is not lowered. `#[warn(tigerstyle::safety)]` followed by `#[deny(tigerstyle::safety)]` is therefore accepted, while `#[warn(tigerstyle::safety)]` followed by only `#[deny(tigerstyle::no_unwrap)]` still lowers `unjustified_no_todo_allow` and is rejected. A `deny` placed before the lowering attribute does not count.

Both checks also read the literal attributes in a `macro_rules!` body where the macro is defined, whether or not the crate invokes it. A `#[macro_export]` macro whose body holds `#[allow(tigerstyle::structure)]` is therefore rejected in the crate that defines it, and an unjustified `#[allow(tigerstyle::no_unwrap)]` in that body is reported there. In a crate that only invokes the macro, the expansion counts as another crate's macro output. Attributes that a macro builds from fragments, such as `#[$meta]`, are checked where the macro expands. A local macro's attribute is reported once, however often the macro expands.

The Nix-packaged runner includes Cargo, the pinned Rust toolchain, Dylint driver/library, and linker closure. A dependency-bearing consumer with build scripts or proc macros can therefore run the package directly; it does not need an ambient consumer dev shell merely to link dependencies.

Core scopes are workspace-relative path prefixes. Octet trims each entry, strips a leading `./` and a trailing `/`, and matches whole path components from the workspace root: `crates/core` covers `crates/core/src/lib.rs` but not `crates/core-shell/src/lib.rs`, `domain-core/src` does not cover `crates/domain-core/src/lib.rs`, and a scope may name a single file such as `src/lib.rs`. Rustc file names are made relative to rustc's working directory, which Cargo sets to the workspace root, before matching; rustc names a file by the path it reached it through, without resolving symlinks, so a scope always covers files compiled through its own path. The lint library also resolves each scope on disk, following symlinks and `..` the way profile preparation does, and a scope that resolves inside the root also covers that canonical workspace-relative path: an in-root `linked -> src` scope covers `src/lib.rs`, and `crates/x/../core/src` covers `crates/core/src`. A scope that names no existing file or directory or resolves to the workspace root itself matches nothing, and a scope whose target lies outside the root, such as `src/core -> ../../shared/core`, matches only files compiled through its in-root path; the lint run warns about each and says which. A scope that used to match by substring must be rewritten as a path from the workspace root. The same resolution, matching, and warnings apply to `state_machine_core_scopes` and `state_machine_generated_adapter_scopes`.

Within declared core scopes, `concrete_construction_in_core` classifies direct `Type::new()` and `Type::default()` calls by the constructed `Self` type of the called associated function, so fallible constructors returning `Result<T, _>` or `Option<T>` are classified by `T`. Local-domain and `core`/`alloc`/`std` constructed types are not external dependency construction, and one direct external call emits at most one finding even when nested in a larger expression. This remains a bounded HIR/source-shape heuristic: external factories with other names and semantic dependency behavior are outside its claim.

## Bootstrap deterministic core

Declare the core paths in canonical consumer configuration:

```toml
[octet]
core_source_scopes = ["crates/domain-core/src/"]
```

`deterministic-core` rejects a missing, empty, absolute, or workspace-escaping scope before Cargo runs; a scope escapes when it has a `..` component or when its symlink-resolved path leaves the workspace root, and the error names `core_source_scopes` in `dylint.toml`. When no explicit `--function-address-path` is supplied, these paths also define its function-address universe. Octet reads these scopes, and every other lint setting, only from the workspace `dylint.toml`; `cargo octet check` and `cargo octet admit` exit 2 before Cargo runs if `DYLINT_TOML` is set, because Dylint would otherwise lint under that variable's config while the evidence names the file's.

First produce and review a source-shape baseline without requesting strict admission:

```bash
cargo octet check \
  --function-addresses observe \
  --function-address-path crates/domain-core/src/ \
  --artifact-dir artifacts/octet-observe
```

Then use the reviewed report as the deny-mode baseline:

```bash
cargo octet check \
  --profile deterministic-core \
  --function-address-baseline artifacts/octet-observe/function-addresses.json \
  --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
```

An explicit operator mode stronger than a profile floor is preserved. Explicit function-address paths and baselines are also preserved; a profile only supplies paths when none were requested. `--function-address-path` and `--function-address-baseline` need `--function-addresses observe|warn|deny` or a strict profile (from `--profile` or an architecture admission binding), and each effective function-address path, explicit or profile-supplied, must stay inside the workspace root after resolving symlinks; otherwise the check exits 2 before Cargo runs and names the flag or config entry that supplied the path. While collecting, a symlinked directory or `.rs` file inside an effective scope that resolves outside the workspace root is refused, not followed. Without any effective path, as under `robust` and `bounded-systems`, the whole workspace root is scanned, and there a symlinked directory resolving outside the root, such as a Nix `result` link, a nix-direnv `.direnv` input, or a crate linked in from elsewhere in a monorepo, is skipped without being followed; a symlinked `.rs` file resolving outside the root is still refused. The workspace-relative path of each skipped link is recorded in `function-addresses.json` under `skipped_directory_links`, and a `note:` line on stderr names the path and its target, so a linked-in crate that Cargo lints but the scan left out stays visible. The target is left out of the artifact because it is machine-specific (a home directory, or a Nix store path that changes on every rebuild) and would make the artifact non-reproducible; see [function fingerprints](function-fingerprints.md#source-scanner-boundaries).

Function-address evidence remains source-scanner identity. It does not establish HIR/MIR equivalence, semantic dependency closure, compiler correctness, whole-program safety, verifier soundness, or release eligibility.

## Evidence binding

Strict-profile selection is visible or cryptographically bound in:

- `command.txt` through the normalized `--profile` invocation;
- `summary.txt` through `Profile`, `Config hash`, and `Profile hash`;
- `status.json` through `metadata.profile_name`, `metadata.config_hash`, and `metadata.profile_hash`;
- `provenance.jsonl` through `checked_scope = "profile:<PROFILE>"` and artifact BLAKE3 identities;
- `function-addresses.json` when the profile floor enables that rail.

Changing the selected profile or its generated policy changes the BLAKE3 configuration/profile identity. `cargo octet artifact verify` recomputes artifact hashes and checks profile-scoped provenance coverage, but verification remains evidence-integrity validation rather than behavioral proof.

## Compatibility

Without `--profile`, `cargo octet check` retains the existing `workspace-metadata` profile, consumer configuration behavior, hashes, and function-address default. The runner removes any ambient `OCTET_STRICT_PROFILE` value from an unprofiled child process, so shell state cannot silently opt a check into strict behavior.

## Current boundary and next layers

This profile rail composes existing direct source/HIR checks. Its first Valence downstream pilot also demonstrates that packaging success, lint precision, profile admission, and function-address identity are separate observations; none promotes another into semantic proof.

Octet now provides a separate `cargo octet admit --profile deterministic-core --closure` rail for conservative selected source-token effect propagation under exact function-address-bound call summaries. It emits its own receipt and preserves explicit limits around name resolution, macros, traits, MIR, dependency implementations, and runtime behavior; see [`effect-closure-admission.md`](effect-closure-admission.md). Capability-typed trait contracts, compiler-backed closure versions, dependency implementation evidence, and required proof rails remain future evidence layers rather than implicit profile claims.
