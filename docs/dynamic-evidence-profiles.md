# Dynamic evidence profiles

Tiger Style lints are the default guardrail, but some bug classes need runtime or profiling evidence. Use these profiles when a change touches the matching risk area. Do not add heavyweight tools to the default consumer path unless a separate OpenSpec promotes one profile into a required rail.

## Profile selection

| Profile | Run when | Acceptance signal | Evidence to save |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory and allocation | Unsafe code, FFI ownership, allocator-sensitive code, or suspected leaks | The selected tool finishes without invalid access/leak findings, or the transcript names accepted third-party suppressions | Tool command, target binary/test, version, suppression file if any, and summary finding count |
| Heap growth | Queues, caches, batching, or retention behavior changes | Peak heap or retained bytes match the review budget, or the delta is explained against the napkin sketch | Heap profile summary plus the expected byte/item bound |
| Cache or hot path | Data-plane loops, parsers, encoders, schedulers, or code changed for speed | Profile identifies the claimed hot path and does not show unexpected branch/cache/allocation dominance | Workload description, profile command, top functions/lines, and comparison to the performance sketch |
| Race and concurrency | Locking, atomics, channels, task topology, or replay/idempotence changes | Loom/Miri/sanitizer/model run passes for the scoped fixture, or remaining risk is escalated to human review | Scenario name, scheduler/model bounds, failing seed if any, and pass/fail summary |
| Unsafe or FFI boundary | New `unsafe`, raw pointers, C ABI, lifetime erasure, or external ownership changes | Miri/sanitizer/Valgrind-style run covers the boundary fixture and the unsafe invariant checklist is complete | Boundary fixture, exact command, unsafe invariant checklist, and diagnostic transcript |
| Release readiness | Before tagging or before enabling a hard gate for a high-risk crate | Static Octet check passes and the one selected dynamic profile for the highest-risk path has saved evidence | Release candidate revision, static check transcript, selected dynamic profile transcript |

## Run timing

- **Always/local default:** static Octet and standards checks only.
- **After a big change:** select the profile for the changed risk surface.
- **When a bug is suspected:** select the profile that can reproduce or falsify the suspected class.
- **Before release:** run static checks plus one selected high-risk dynamic profile.
- **Focused CI or nightly:** use longer profiles only after the owning OpenSpec says which tool, workload, and acceptance signal are required.

## Evidence rules

Every saved dynamic evidence artifact must include:

1. The exact command and working directory.
2. Tool version or Nix/app derivation when available.
3. The target workload, fixture, or test name.
4. Expected acceptance signal before the run.
5. Observed result and whether suppressions were used.
6. Link back to the OpenSpec scenario or review checklist row.

## Non-goals

- Do not require Valgrind, Miri, sanitizers, heap profilers, cache profilers, or Loom for ordinary consumer lint runs.
- Do not treat a profiler result as design proof unless it is compared to a workload sketch.
- Do not accept "ran tool" as evidence without the acceptance signal and finding summary.
