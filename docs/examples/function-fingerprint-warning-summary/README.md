# Function fingerprint warning summary example

This example documents operator-facing warning summary fields for
`cargo tigerstyle fingerprint` human output. It keeps one marked function with a
macro call but no `macro=allow`, and one marked function without `review=` or
`evidence=` metadata, so the transcript records both `macro_warnings` and
`metadata_missing` counts.

The executable regression asserts that the transcript stdout stays synchronized
with the CLI and that the updated scratch fixture exactly matches `reviewed.rs`.
