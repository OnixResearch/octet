# Tiger Style Standards Contract

## Purpose

This repo enforces a reusable Rust safety profile through two explicit seams:

- the Dylint lint engine in `src/` and `cargo-octet/`
- the policy registry and standards checker in `standards/` and `crates/octet-standards/`

The machine-readable policy index lives in
[`standards/policies/registry.ncl`](../../standards/policies/registry.ncl). It
links Tiger Style source sections to stable policy IDs, enforcement levels,
current/target enforcement modes, structural mechanisms, proof rails, seed
manifests, checker ownership, suppression requirements, and planned fixture
evidence.

## Functional Core / Imperative Shell

- Standards policy logic MUST live in `crates/octet-standards/src/` as pure
  rule functions over plain inputs.
- Filesystem walking, JSON loading, CLI parsing, and exit-code mapping MUST stay
  in the `octet-standards` binary shell.
- Dylint lint implementation MUST stay in `src/`; standards policy checks MUST
  not be folded into the compiler-plugin crate unless they need rustc HIR.
- `cargo-octet/` MUST remain the lint runner seam for downstream projects.

## Policy Registry

- Policy IDs use the `octet.<pillar>.<rule>` namespace.
- Suppressions use `octet-allow:` comments and MUST cite policy ID, source
  section, owner, rationale, review trigger, and safer default for hard rules.
  A valid suppression covers only diagnostics of its policy at its own path and
  line: `scope=line` (the default) covers the annotated line and
  `scope=next-line` the line after it. Covered diagnostics no longer block;
  the report records them under `suppressed_diagnostics` (markdown
  `## Suppressed Findings`) next to `active_suppressions`. Diagnostics about
  suppressions themselves are never suppressed.
- Hard policies need positive and negative fixtures before becoming blocking.
- Policies that target `structural` MUST export at least one mechanism contract
  such as crate-boundary, capability-api, bounded-primitive, or type-state.
- Crate-boundary mechanisms that declare shell crates drive a
  dependency-direction check over the `cargo metadata --format-version 1`
  crate graph, taken from a `__octet/cargo-metadata.json` source or run from
  the nearest `Cargo.toml` ancestor of a `--source` path. The check fails
  closed with an error diagnostic when no source lies in a Cargo workspace,
  cargo metadata fails, the metadata has no `resolve` graph (as with
  `--no-deps`), or a declared `core_crates`, `shell_crates`, or
  `adapter_crates` entry matches no package or no resolved workspace member.
- Capability-api mechanisms export forbidden ambient authority APIs, declared
  scope classes, capability families, core scopes, shell constructor scopes,
  approved capability names, injected traits/tokens, shell interpreters, and
  deterministic handler evidence so the architecture checker can reject
  core-side ambient effects and emit capability reports from generated policy
  artifacts. The report validates declared policy and observed source shapes
  only; it is not a Rust effect system, transitive purity proof, or
  whole-program runtime-effect absence claim.
- Bounded-primitive mechanisms export forbidden unbounded APIs, approved bounded
  constructors/wrappers, capacity witnesses, and backpressure/overflow witnesses.
- Policies that target `verified` MUST export a proof rail with a command argv,
  exact or globbed source/proof/receipt path mappings, pass signal,
  trust-boundary accounting, verifier mode, receipt-binding mode, and receipt
  provenance obligations. Verification-family checks treat source mappings,
  proof artifact pass signals, and receipt paths as hard artifact obligations:
  by default, a selected verified policy fails unless the declared source, proof,
  and receipt files are present in the checked source tree and the proof artifact
  contains the exact configured pass signal. A receipt that records an
  `exit-status:` line, as `octet-standards check --execute-proof-rails` writes,
  also fails unless the recorded status is `0`; spawn errors and signals fail.
  Rails with
  `receipt_binding = "blake3-command-and-source"` also require command and source
  BLAKE3 bindings matching the configured argv and checked source contents.
  Rails with `receipt_provenance` configured also require matching
  `proof-receipt-schema`, `proof-backend`, `proof-runner`, `proof-environment`,
  and configured `trust-boundary` entries. Rails with `receipt_verifier`
  configured also require exact verifier/toolchain accounting for verifier,
  solver, binary, build closure, Nix derivation, Nix closure, Nix closure graph,
  and toolchain identity. Fixture rails MUST mark `verifier_mode = "fixture"`;
  production Verus rails MUST mark `verifier_mode = "production"` and pin real
  verifier, solver, and toolchain identity. If verifier build-closure, Nix
  closure, or Nix closure graph paths are configured, the corresponding digest is
  derived from checked manifest or graph file contents instead of trusting
  ambient build state; structured Verus receipts record the derived digest, so a
  manifest or graph that no longer hashes to the pinned digest fails receipt
  validation. Before executing a production Verus rail, `cargo octet prove`
  runs the resolved verifier with `--identity` and fails the rail as an
  `unpinned-verifier` unless the reported `proof-verifier-binary-blake3`,
  `proof-solver-blake3`, and `proof-toolchain-blake3` equal the pinned digests.
  `cargo octet prove` executes only configured rail argv,
  captures bounded stdout/stderr artifacts, writes structured JSON receipts at
  configured receipt paths, and then emits `formal_proof` provenance only after
  the same pass-signal, binding, provenance, verifier/toolchain, binary, and
  closure gates pass. Command execution is explicit opt-in; read-only receipt
  checking remains the default for consumer safety.
- Proof-relevant seed manifests MUST remain untrusted until a local acceptance
  command or human/oracle review records provenance and re-verification.
- Advisory and human-process-only policies stay visible without pretending static
  tooling can judge them.

## Testing Rules

- Test suites MUST include both positive and negative cases.
- Standards checker tests MUST exercise pure rule functions directly.
- Fixture rails MUST prove compliant and noncompliant examples separately.
- Error-path tests MUST prove the exact failure surface: returned error variant,
  message, and no hidden panic.

## Numeric and Unsafe Discipline

- Non-obvious numeric literals MUST be named constants, parameters, or config
  values.
- Every unsafe block MUST be documented, or unsafe MUST be absent.
- Core validation helpers SHOULD prefer named input structs over ambiguous
  same-typed parameter lists.

## Verification Commands

Run these inside `nix develop` or through `nix develop path:. -c ...`:

```bash
cargo test -p octet-standards
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
nix run .#octet-policy-validate
nix run .#octet-standards -- --help
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.policy-registry --no-link
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.standards-fixtures --no-link
nix run .#cargo-octet -- check
```
