# Evidence codebase index

`cargo octet evidence-index codebase` builds a local, deterministic Octet-owned review index over existing Octet evidence artifacts. It is a map for reviewers and scripts: finding, lint, policy, requirement, fingerprint, provenance, proof-card, replay-capsule, transcript, and evidence-log identities link back to concrete artifact files and replay commands.

The pure indexing core is consumed from the exact standalone `valence-core::evidence_codebase_index` dependency through Octet's compatibility shim. Octet retains CLI parsing, filesystem traversal, artifact discovery, output writing, Nix gate ownership, release bundle ownership, and non-claim boundary enforcement; standalone Valence ownership of the pure core does not transfer Octet's product or release responsibilities.

## Build

```sh
cargo octet check --output-format json --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
cargo octet evidence-index codebase build \
  --artifact artifacts/octet/results.jsonl \
  --artifact artifacts/octet/provenance.jsonl \
  --output target/octet-evidence-index/evidence-codebase-index.json
```

Use repeated `--artifact PATH` for explicit files and repeated `--artifact-dir DIR` for directories. Directory scans include supported `.json`, `.jsonl`, and `.md` evidence files and skip `.git`, `.jj`, and `target` directories.

Write the index and the HTML page outside every directory passed to `--artifact-dir` and outside Octet artifact bundles such as `artifacts/octet`: `cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` reports any file it did not write as an unexpected artifact. `target/` is a good home because directory scans skip it. A build never reads its own `--output` file back from a scanned directory.

A `cargo octet check` bundle also holds runner records (`status.json`, `command.txt`, `summary.txt`). No supported artifact family covers `status.json`, so `--artifact-dir artifacts/octet` over a check bundle reports it as `unsupported_family` in strict mode; name the bundle's `results.jsonl` (written by `--output-format json`) and `provenance.jsonl` with `--artifact` instead. A check with no findings writes an empty `results.jsonl`, which strict mode also reports as `unsupported_family`; index only `provenance.jsonl` in that case. The provenance records still name the runner files, which appear as `provenance.referenced_artifact_missing` caveats.

Strict mode is the default. Missing required identity fields, malformed JSON, stale supplied artifact hashes, and unsupported artifact families are reported as deterministic `error` issues and the command exits non-zero. `--advisory` records those conditions as caveats for exploratory review without inventing missing identities.

Each action accepts only its own flags; for example, `query` rejects `--output` and `--advisory` instead of ignoring them.

## Query

```sh
cargo octet evidence-index codebase query \
  --index target/octet-evidence-index/evidence-codebase-index.json \
  --identity octet.runner.artifact-bundle
```

Queries match stable record IDs, artifact locators, BLAKE3 artifact hashes, requirement IDs such as `r[octet.evidence_codebase_index.query.lookup]`, lint IDs, policy IDs, fingerprints, provenance source IDs such as the check bundle's `octet.runner.artifact-bundle`, and replay capsule identities. Query output includes directly matching records and deterministic linked records, including parent artifacts and shared requirement/lint/policy/fingerprint links. Query prints to standard output and exits non-zero when no record matches.

## Static HTML

```sh
cargo octet evidence-index codebase html \
  --index target/octet-evidence-index/evidence-codebase-index.json \
  --output target/octet-evidence-index/evidence-codebase-index.html
```

The HTML page is rendered from the same normalized index model as JSON query output. It is intended for local static browsing; no hosted service is required.

## Supported artifact families

The first implementation ingests current Octet surfaces without replacing their source formats:

- `cargo octet check` finding JSON/JSONL records.
- Octet provenance JSONL records.
- `cargo octet prove` proof-card decks.
- Function fingerprint review manifests.
- Replay capsules from `cargo octet roadmap capsule`.
- Transcript assertion reports and markdown transcripts.
- Evidence log manifests.
- Evidence rail receipts and their findings.

## Boundary

Every generated index and HTML page states the same non-claim boundary: the Octet evidence codebase index proves artifact identity and linkage only. It does not claim whole-program correctness, semantic equivalence, complete dependency closure, distributed execution correctness, remote code mobility, standalone Valence release ownership, or formal proof unless a linked formal-proof receipt scopes that stronger claim.
