# Octet adoption story

Octet is a Rust-compatible, evidence-backed checked path for systems code before
release. Existing Rust source enters Octet checks without a rewrite, and the
result is reviewable because every claim points to a command, checked-in policy,
receipt, transcript, or artifact.

## Checked path promise

The adoption path is deliberately concrete:

```text
Rust source
  -> cargo octet check
  -> checked-in config or policy (`dylint.toml`, `[workspace.metadata.octet]`, policy bundles)
  -> evidence artifacts (`status.json`, SARIF, JSONL findings, transcripts, provenance)
  -> CI or release gate
  -> artifact verification before promotion
```

That path covers lint findings, standards checks, optional scoped proof receipts,
provenance, and artifact verification. It is an incremental Rust adoption path,
not a new programming language and not a Rust replacement.

## Public story cards

A first-pass Octet story should fit on one skim surface. These cards are the
canonical inventory for a public landing page, README excerpt, or sales handoff;
longer reference docs should link here instead of repeating the whole story.

| Card | Reader promise | Concrete Octet surface | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checked path card | Existing Rust moves through a local checked path before promotion. | `cargo octet check`, checked-in config, policy bundles, artifact directory, CI or release gate | Not a new language and not a Rust replacement. |
| How it works cards | Each layer names what it checks and what evidence it emits. | static lint edge, Nickel policy layer, evidence chain, optional scoped proof lane, artifact verification, controlled deployment | Validation evidence is not silently upgraded into formal proof. |
| Built with Octet evidence card | Case studies are reviewable because they name source, scope, command, config, artifact, outcome, and boundary. | Aspen phase-1 archive plus future case-study records | Historical rollout evidence is not a claim about every future consumer or Octet HEAD. |
| Before/after examples card | Ordinary Rust failure shapes map to bounded remediation paths. | existing lint families such as `unchecked_division`, `unchecked_narrowing`, `unbounded_channel`, `ambient_clock`, `public_unsafe_api`, and `ignored_result` | Lint examples are not solver models or formal counterexamples. |
| Quickstart card | A reader can copy commands from first check to saved artifacts and artifact verification. | `cargo octet check --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` and `cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` | Output is local review evidence; consumers still own CI storage and release decisions. |
| FAQ card | Comparison and boundary questions are answered before marketing claims expand. | Clippy comparison, proof scope, unsupported proof claims, Dylint/nightly tradeoff, source/artifact locality, starter-profile noise, and `cargo octet prove` usage | No mathematical certainty, whole-program proof, certification, C performance parity, or verified runtime claim. |

## How it works cards

| Surface | What the card should say | Evidence a reviewer can inspect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static lint edge | Octet adds Tiger Style Dylint checks for known source shapes that Rust and Clippy do not target as Octet policy. | stderr, SARIF, JSONL findings, lint names, stable IDs, and remediation text from `cargo octet check`. |
| Nickel policy layer | Human-authored policy and config live in typed Nickel or checked-in config, then export deterministic tool inputs. | `standards/policies/`, generated policy bundles, `octet-policy-validate`, and `octet-standards check`. |
| Evidence chain | A run is reviewable because sidecars and provenance record command, tool, evidence tier, artifact locator, BLAKE3 hash, and checked scope. | `status.json`, `summary.txt`, `results.jsonl`, `results.sarif`, transcripts, fingerprints, and `provenance.jsonl`. |
| Optional scoped proof lane | `cargo octet prove` is opt-in and records verifier-backed receipts only for declared properties and source/proof bindings. | proof receipts, proof cards, bounded logs, `formal_proof` provenance, and artifact verification. |
| Artifact verification | Saved evidence is checked before promotion instead of trusted by path name. | `cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` recomputes identities and fails closed on stale or malformed bundles. |
| Controlled deployment | Octet runs locally or inside consumer CI with a pinned runner path and local artifacts. | `cargo octet check`, `nix run ...#cargo-octet -- check`, `lib.mkConsumerCheck`, and `trust-boundary-evidence.md#controlled-deployment-posture`. |

## Built with Octet case-study format

A public "Built with Octet" case study is reviewable only when it names every
field below:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| consumer or archive source | repository, commit, or archived evidence source |
| checked scope | package, crate, source path, policy family, or proof rail scope |
| command or gate | Octet command, CI check, transcript command, or release gate |
| configuration source | `dylint.toml`, `[workspace.metadata.octet]`, policy bundle, proof rail, or archived config snapshot |
| evidence artifact or archive path | transcript, receipt, sidecar, provenance file, policy artifact, or archive path |
| outcome summary | bounded findings, pass/fail status, suppression decision, or rollout status |
| scope boundary | what the evidence does not prove or what remains manual review |

### Built with Octet: Aspen phase-1 starter rollout

- consumer or archive source:
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-13-aspen-consumer-rollout/`
- checked scope: Aspen commit `909e5e9fa`, starter packages `aspen-time`,
  `aspen-hlc`, and `aspen-core`
- command or gate: archived phase-1 default run captured in
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-13-aspen-consumer-rollout/evidence/aspen-default-run.txt`
- configuration source:
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-13-aspen-consumer-rollout/rollout-notes.md`
  plus the archived wrapper/config snapshot named by
  `docs/downstream-rollout-evidence.md`
- evidence artifact or archive path:
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-13-aspen-consumer-rollout/evidence/validation-counts.txt`
  and the default-run transcript above
- outcome summary: the phase-1 starter run produced six findings, all
  `ambient_clock`, on the starter package set; that bounded signal informed the
  starter rollout profile
- scope boundary: this is historical rollout evidence for the archived starter
  scope, not Aspen HEAD, not whole-program proof, not certification, and not a
  claim that every later lint family is low-noise

The Aspen entry intentionally cites the canonical phase-1 archive. Mutable local
Aspen worktrees and later widened scripts are useful for follow-up experiments,
but they are not the source for the starter case study.

## Before and after examples

These examples are story cards, not a replacement for the full lint catalog. Each
one names the lint or policy surface, the deterministic failure shape, and the
bounded remediation path. They are lint and policy examples, not SMT models, not solver models, not formal
counterexamples, not mathematical proof, and not solver results.

### `unchecked_division`: zero guard before division

Before:

```rust
fn average(total: u64, count: u64) -> u64 {
    total / count
}
```

After:

```rust
fn average(total: u64, count: u64) -> Result<u64, &'static str> {
    if count == 0 {
        return Err("count must be non-zero");
    }
    Ok(total / count)
}
```

Failure shape: a divisor can be zero. Remediation: add an explicit guard and
return a recoverable error instead of hiding a panic path.

### `unchecked_narrowing`: checked conversion at an API edge

Before:

```rust
fn encode_len(len: usize) -> u32 {
    len as u32
}
```

After:

```rust
fn encode_len(len: usize) -> Result<u32, std::num::TryFromIntError> {
    u32::try_from(len)
}
```

Failure shape: a platform-sized value can truncate. Remediation: use a checked
conversion or a prior range assertion tied to the same value.

### `unbounded_channel` and `unbounded_collection_growth`: resource boundary

Before:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel();
```

After:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(config.command_queue_capacity);
```

Failure shape: producer pressure has no visible capacity bound. Remediation:
name the queue capacity in config, document backpressure, and save rollout
evidence when promoting the lint family.

### `ambient_clock`: shell/core split

Before:

```rust
fn expire_at(ttl: std::time::Duration) -> std::time::Instant {
    std::time::Instant::now() + ttl
}
```

After:

```rust
fn expire_at(now: std::time::Instant, ttl: std::time::Duration) -> std::time::Instant {
    now + ttl
}
```

Failure shape: core logic reads wall-clock time directly. Remediation: pass time
from the imperative shell into a deterministic core function.

### `public_unsafe_api`: safe wrapper or documented exception

Before:

```rust
pub unsafe fn read_word(ptr: *const u32) -> u32 {
    *ptr
}
```

After:

```rust
pub fn read_word(word: &u32) -> u32 {
    *word
}
```

Failure shape: a public API exports caller obligations that ordinary Rust call
sites cannot check. Remediation: expose a safe wrapper around a narrow private
unsafe helper, or document an explicit exception with caller obligation, reviewer
action, evidence tier, and non-claim.

### `ignored_result`: explicit error propagation

Before:

```rust
let _ = writer.flush();
```

After:

```rust
writer.flush()?;
```

Failure shape: a fallible result is silently dropped. Remediation: propagate the
error, handle it locally, or document why the result is intentionally irrelevant.

## Terminal-first quickstart

Use this quickstart when a reader wants one path from first check to reviewable
artifacts. Consumer repos should still keep their own `dylint.toml` and
`[workspace.metadata.octet]` runner scope checked in.

```bash
cp /path/to/octet/templates/dylint.toml dylint.toml
cat >> Cargo.toml <<'TOML'
[workspace.metadata.octet]
default_scope = ["-p", "your-core-crate"]
cargo_check_args = ["--lib"]
TOML
cargo octet check --artifact-dir artifacts/octet --output-format sarif
cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
```

Expected reviewable outputs include:

- `artifacts/octet/command.txt` with the replayable command;
- `artifacts/octet/status.json` with exit status, counts, selected profile, and replay metadata;
- `artifacts/octet/summary.txt` with the human effect-summary output;
- `artifacts/octet/results.sarif` or `artifacts/octet/results.jsonl` for findings;
- `artifacts/octet/provenance.jsonl` with source IDs, checker IDs, evidence tiers, artifact locators, BLAKE3 hashes, and checked scopes.

A warning-only run can still exit successfully; teams decide when to promote
warning families to deny gates or pre-commit hooks after inventorying starter
noise.

## FAQ

### Why not just Clippy?

Use Clippy too. Octet targets Tiger Style and evidence-contract surfaces that are
specific to this project: checked artifact bundles, policy IDs, rollout profiles,
proof-card provenance, and lints such as ambient clock boundaries or public
unsafe API obligations. Clippy cleanliness and Octet cleanliness are both review
inputs, not whole-program proof.

### What does Octet prove?

The default `cargo octet check` path proves only that selected static and policy
checks ran and emitted reviewable evidence for their scopes. Optional
`cargo octet prove` rails can support `formal_proof` evidence only for a declared
property, verifier identity, source/proof binding, receipt, and artifact identity.

### What does Octet not prove?

Octet does not provide mathematical certainty, whole-program correctness,
certification, business-domain validation, semantic equivalence, C performance
parity, a verified runtime, or Salt-style language syntax such as `requires`,
`ensures`, or `@trusted`.

### Why Dylint or nightly?

Octet currently uses Dylint and rustc-private surfaces because several checks
need compiler internals that stable plugin APIs do not expose. The tradeoff is a
pinned runner/toolchain path and Nix wrappers for reproducibility; consumers pin
the Octet revision before using it as a gate.

### What data leaves my repository?

Octet itself runs locally or in consumer CI and writes local artifacts. It does
not require an Octet-operated upload service. Consumers still own what their CI
provider, log collector, artifact store, or integrations do with those local
outputs.

### How do we handle starter-profile noise?

Start with warning-level inventory, save artifacts, categorize findings, and
promote only lint families whose signal is understood. The Aspen phase-1 archive
is an example of this bounded starter rollout, not a universal noise guarantee.

### When should we use `cargo octet prove`?

Use proof rails when a scoped property already has a verifier configuration or a
proof card that reviewers need to validate before release. Do not use proof rails
to waive unrelated lint findings, certify the whole system, or replace human
review of business requirements.

## Methodology before public metrics

Public performance, cache, CI-latency, suppression-rate, false-positive, or
rollout-cost metrics should be published only with methodology. A metric is ready
for publication only when it names:

- command or gate that produced the measurement;
- input scope and configuration;
- environment or platform when it affects the result;
- raw artifact, transcript, or reproducible evidence path;
- interpretation boundary for the metric.

A candidate metric without those fields is held back until the raw command and
artifact path exist. For example, a cache-speed claim should name the exact
`cargo octet check` invocation, package scope, cache status fields, platform,
artifact directory or transcript, and the boundary that the value describes only
that run.

## Boundary-preserving comparison

Octet's adoption advantage is compatibility with existing Rust workspaces and
release gates. It can be compared with new-language or verifier-first tools only
by staying within supported evidence: Rust-compatible static checks, policy
checks, optional scoped proof receipts, provenance, and artifact verification.

Octet does not claim mathematical certainty, whole-program correctness,
certification, a verified runtime, language-level contract syntax, C performance
parity, or Salt-style trusted-code semantics unless a separate accepted
requirement and evidence artifact supports that exact claim.
