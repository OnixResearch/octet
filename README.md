# Octet

Octet is the evidence-backed checked path for agent-written and human-written
Rust systems code. It is a Rust-compatible toolchain and lint distribution for
systems code that should be stable through closed interfaces. It applies
[Tiger Style](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md)
rules: explicit shell/core boundaries, bounded resource use, positive naming,
compact functions, and reviewable suppressions.

The checked path is concrete: Rust source flows through `cargo octet check` and
`octet-standards` checks, checked-in policy/config, reviewable evidence
artifacts, then consumer CI or release gates. See
`docs/trust-boundary-evidence.md` for the evidence stack, evidence tiers,
provenance chain, scope boundary, and controlled-deployment map.

The chemistry metaphor is intentional: an octet is a stable full valence shell.
Octet treats Rust-compatible code as inert by default across APIs, effects,
capabilities, proofs, and review surfaces; interaction happens only through
complete, explicit interfaces.

Octet currently ships 68 Dylint lints across 6 domains. The repo also owns a
separate standards registry/checker seam for policy traceability and
non-Dylint source-shape rules.

## Quick start

1. Copy `templates/dylint.toml` into the consumer workspace as `dylint.toml`.
2. Add runner metadata to the workspace `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.octet]
default_scope = ["-p", "your-core-crate"]
cargo_check_args = ["--lib"]
```

3. Run Octet through the first-class runner.

Installed cargo subcommand:

```bash
cargo octet check
```

Nix, from the canonical repo flake without installing into the consumer toolchain:

```bash
nix run github:OnixResearch/octet#cargo-octet -- check
```

Local checkout alternative:

```bash
nix run path:/path/to/octet#cargo-octet -- check
```

Structured output and reviewable sidecars are first-class too:

```bash
cargo octet check --output-format sarif --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
```

Optional external evidence rails collect selected non-starter tool output into separate receipt bundles:

```bash
cargo octet evidence collect --rail dependency-audit --input target/deny.json --config deny.toml --locked --artifact-dir artifacts/dependency-audit
cargo octet evidence collect --rail hegel-property --input target/hegel-property.json --artifact-dir artifacts/hegel-property
cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/dependency-audit
```

For a strict local gate, copy `templates/pre-commit-config.yaml` to a consumer
repo and pin this repository as a pre-commit hook source. The `octet-deny-all`
hook runs the same runner with every Octet/Tiger Style lint promoted to `deny`.

Exit codes stay stable for automation:

- `0` clean or warning-only runs
- `1` error-level lint findings
- `2` integration or cargo-check failures

Outside Nix, install the cargo subcommand once, then follow
`docs/consumer-guide.md` for the repo-pinned `OCTET_DYLINT_REV` bootstrap
before running `cargo octet check`:

```bash
cargo install --path /path/to/octet/cargo-octet
```

4. Tune thresholds, disabled lints, and per-lint levels in `dylint.toml`.

After TOML syntax parses, Octet accumulates independent semantic config diagnostics (for example unknown lint names, invalid levels, and conflicting disabled/level entries) in deterministic order while still ignoring invalid entries and failing closed before dependent evidence promotion.

Standards registry checks live behind a separate command surface:

```bash
nix run .#octet-policy-validate
nix run .#octet-standards -- --help
```

Formal proof rails are opt-in. `cargo octet prove` lists or runs selected
standards proof rails, writes structured verifier receipts plus `proof-cards.json`
under an artifact directory, and emits `formal_proof` provenance only for scoped
receipts with verifier, solver/toolchain, command argv, source/proof path,
receipt path, and bounded log identity. Starter `cargo octet check` usage does
not require Verus.
Octet keeps the fixture `octet-verus` rail for plumbing tests and also ships
multiple tiny production-mode pilots through `octet-production-verus`, pinned to
the real Verus binary release, solver, Rust toolchain, and Nix closure graph
identity. Each pilot proves only its declared property and makes no
whole-program correctness claim. The canonical route is documented in
[`docs/trust-boundary-evidence.md#verus-proof-path-lane`](docs/trust-boundary-evidence.md#verus-proof-path-lane):
requirement or policy ID to Verus proof rail, checked Rust source scope, proof
target, verifier identity, structured receipt, proof-card review,
`formal_proof` provenance, and artifact verification. Imported Trellis references
are BLAKE3 byte-identity/manual-review inputs until Octet reruns the proof and
validates its own receipt.

```bash
cargo octet prove --list \
  --policy-artifacts-dir artifacts/policy \
  --source src/verified
cargo octet prove --explain \
  --policy-artifacts-dir artifacts/policy \
  --source src/verified \
  --rail octet.verus_proof_rails.addition-bound-production#rail-0
cargo octet prove \
  --policy-artifacts-dir artifacts/policy \
  --source src/verified \
  --rail octet.verus_proof_rails.addition-bound-production#rail-0 \
  --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
cargo octet proof-ref scaffold \
  --proof-cards artifacts/octet/proof-cards.json \
  --proof-or-property-id octet.verus_proof_rails.addition-bound-production#rail-0 \
  --reference-id unchecked-narrowing-range-proof \
  --consumer-context 'allow tigerstyle::unchecked_narrowing at src/codec.rs:42' \
  --consumer-source src/codec.rs \
  --anchor 'octet-proof-ref: unchecked-narrowing-range-proof -> octet.verus_proof_rails.addition-bound-production#rail-0' \
  --output proof-ref.json
cargo octet proof-ref validate \
  --proof-cards artifacts/octet/proof-cards.json \
  --ref proof-ref.json
cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet
```

Start with `docs/consumer-guide.md` for the full consumer setup and rollout
path. Legacy `cargo slotcar` / `cargo tigerstyle` command names remain
compatibility aliases only.

## Release/operator smoke path

For release readiness, operators should be able to find the critical surfaces from
this README plus command help, without reading archived OpenSpec changes:

- `cargo octet check --cache --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` records
  effect-summary output in `summary.txt`, sidecar findings, `provenance.jsonl`,
  and lint-cache `cache_status` fields. Add `--function-addresses observe|warn|deny`
  plus optional `--function-address-path PATH` entries to gradually content-address
  functions with lint-like diagnostics before promoting selected scopes to `deny`;
  when enabled with `--artifact-dir`, the check writes `function-addresses.json`
  beside the normal bundle sidecars with source envelopes, marker review fields,
  duplicate/malformed/stale diagnostics, and a Kamacite-compatible projection
  descriptor. `observe` is the bootstrap mode: unreviewed or unbaselined
  functions produce renderer-valid warning findings while still emitting the
  artifact for review. Use `--function-address-baseline PATH` to ratchet
  gradually: unchanged baseline functions stay admitted while changed or new
  unaddressed functions report stale/missing diagnostics. These receipts are
  identity and source-shape evidence only; they do not claim Rust semantic
  correctness, compiler correctness, whole-program safety, verifier soundness,
  or release eligibility.
- `cargo octet artifact verify --artifact-dir artifacts/octet` recomputes sidecar
  BLAKE3 hashes and fails closed on missing, stale, malformed, or inconsistent
  provenance before the directory is treated as release evidence. With
  `--emit-valence-provenance PATH`, it writes a replayable, typed Valence adapter
  input only after verification succeeds; r[verify octet.evidence_provenance.valence_export.boundary_hardened.visible]
  the export is not release eligibility, Mantle bundle inclusion, whole-program
  correctness, or verifier-soundness proof.
- `cargo octet evidence collect --rail dependency-audit|clippy-co-reporting|dependency-trust|api-stability|dynamic-evidence|release-supply-chain|mutation-testing|coverage-baseline|kani-model-check|hegel-property`
  writes optional external evidence receipts with checker identity, source severity,
  selected scope, parent links, and explicit non-claims. Kani receipts are scoped
  model-check evidence for named harnesses/contracts/stubs; Hegel receipts are
  bounded generated-input property evidence for named pure-core laws. Neither rail
  is evidence of whole-program correctness, release eligibility, semantic
  equivalence, or verifier soundness.
- `cargo octet fingerprint --check --review-manifest artifacts/fingerprint-review.json src/lib.rs`
  verifies semantic identity fingerprints with BLAKE3-backed review records.
- `cargo octet migrate start --manifest artifacts/octet-migration.json`
  writes a deterministic migration manifest before safe application.
- `cargo octet transcript docs/examples/release-operator-smoke/transcript.md`
  validates executable transcript command blocks and expected-output assertions.

One bounded smoke artifact covers those surfaces together:

```bash
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.docs-examples --no-link -L
```

The smoke transcript lives at
`docs/examples/release-operator-smoke/transcript.md`.

## Naming map

Octet is the canonical current product identity. `Tiger Style` remains the
source philosophy. Current release lint source attrs, domain groups, and emitted
lint group metadata still use `tigerstyle::...` until the namespace migration
lands; Octet command and config names are the preferred product surfaces.

| Surface | Canonical Octet name | Legacy / compatibility classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| public site | `octet.dev` | `slotcar.dev` is historical until a site decision lands |
| project name | `Octet` / `octet` | `slotcar` is legacy product identity |
| GitHub repo reference | `github:OnixResearch/octet` | legacy repo slugs are obsolete |
| crate and lint package | `octet` | `slotcar`/`tigerstyle` package aliases are compatibility only |
| lint runner binary | `cargo-octet` | `cargo-slotcar` and `cargo-tigerstyle` route to the same engine as aliases |
| lint runner command | `cargo octet check` | `cargo slotcar check` and `cargo tigerstyle check` are transition aliases |
| standards checker binary | `octet-standards` | `slotcar-standards` / `tigerstyle-standards` are compatibility aliases |
| standards policy commands | `octet-policy-export`, `octet-policy-validate` | old policy command names are compatibility aliases |
| lint attrs and domain groups | `tigerstyle::<lint>` and `tigerstyle::<domain>` | bare lint names remain compatibility aliases during migration |
| workspace runner config | `[workspace.metadata.octet]` | `[workspace.metadata.slotcar]` is legacy and lower precedence |
| lint tuning config | `[octet]` and `[octet.lint_levels]` | `[slotcar]` is legacy and lower precedence |
| support env prefix | `OCTET_*` | `TIGERSTYLE_*` is bootstrap compatibility while Dylint wiring migrates |

When both Octet and legacy config are present, Octet names win. Remaining
`Tiger Style` references are valid when they describe the coding philosophy or
the current release's live lint namespace; `settle-octet-namespace-migration`
tracks the source-attribute namespace decision.

## Lint domains at a glance
