<!-- Copy this file into openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md and replace the placeholders. -->
<!-- Use this template for active changes under openspec/changes/<change>/; archived changes keep their historical task shape. -->
<!-- Omission-prevention checklist: keep implementation separate from verification/evidence, give every added or modified scenario its own coverage row, and make each H<n> oracle checkpoint self-verifiable with exact command=, input=, asserts=, and evidence= fields. -->

## Task ID rules

- `I<n>` — one implementation claim only. Do not combine code changes with verification runs, saved evidence, or transcript capture in the same checkbox. Split that work into a separate `V<n>` or `H<n>` task.
- Treat an `I<n>` checkbox as invalid if its text includes verification/evidence markers such as `verify`, `save`, `capture`, `evidence=`, or a repo-relative `evidence/` path.
- `V<n>` — one deterministic verification claim for exactly one delta-spec scenario or one requirement-level invariant that has no scenario heading.
- Before marking a change ready, read the delta specs and ensure every added or modified `Scenario:` heading appears in `## Verification Coverage` exactly once. Shared artifacts still need separate scenario rows.
- `H<n>` — one human/oracle checkpoint using the exact field layout shown in `H1` below.
- Treat an `H<n>` checkbox as invalid if any of `command=`, `input=`, `asserts=`, or `evidence=` is missing.
- Treat an `H<n>` checkbox as underspecified if `command=` is a broad workflow instead of an exact command/helper, `input=` omits the pinned fixture or prerequisite artifact, `asserts=` bundles multiple human claims, or `evidence=` omits the saved review artifact path.

## Phase 1: Implementation

- [ ] I1 Implement <one code or document change>
- [ ] I2 Update <one follow-on code or document change>

Bad: `- [ ] I3 update parser and save cargo-test-lib.txt`
Good: `- [ ] I3 update parser` plus `- [ ] V4 save cargo-test-lib.txt`

## Phase 2: Deterministic verification

- [ ] V1 Verify scenario "<Scenario heading>" with <test/helper>; save output at `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/<artifact>.txt`
- [ ] V2 Verify requirement "<Requirement heading>" with <test/helper>; save output at `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/<artifact>.txt`

## Phase 3: Human/oracle checkpoints

- [ ] H1 Human/oracle checkpoint: command=`<exact command or helper path>`; input=`<pinned revision, fixture, or prerequisite artifact>`; asserts=`<single human claim>`; evidence=`openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/<artifact>.txt`

## Change Status
- Status: in-progress
- Open tasks: I1, I2, V1, V2, H1
Use `Open tasks: none` only when every governed `I<n>`, `V<n>`, and `H<n>` task checkbox is checked.
## Verification Coverage

- `Scenario: <Scenario heading>` -> `V1` -> `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/<artifact>.txt`
- `Requirement: <Requirement heading>` -> `V2` -> `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/<artifact>.txt`

Use one coverage row for every added or modified scenario heading.
Use `Requirement:` rows only when a requirement has zero scenario headings.
Multiple rows may point at the same artifact, but each scenario still needs its
own row.

Bad: `Scenario: A and B` -> `V3` -> `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/shared.txt`
Good:
- `Scenario: A` -> `V3` -> `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/shared.txt`
- `Scenario: B` -> `V4` -> `openspec/changes/<change>/evidence/shared.txt`
