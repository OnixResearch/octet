## Phase 1: Implementation

- [ ] I1 Implement normalized artifact DTOs and content-addressed storage for prompt, tool-schema, model-request, session-block, receipt, and skill/tool-definition records
- [ ] I2 Implement tool ability manifests and policy/replay handlers for declared effect families
- [ ] I3 Implement name-to-hash pointer registry updates, inspect output, and rollback operation
- [ ] I4 Implement typed durable session record DTOs and migration handling
- [ ] I5 Document structured session todo states and add machine-readable display or export path
- [ ] I6 Implement pure-result cache key DTOs, cache hit/miss receipts, and eligibility checks

## Phase 2: Deterministic verification

- [ ] V1 Verify scenario "Hash normalized artifacts" with artifact hash fixtures; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/artifact-hash-normalization.txt`
- [ ] V2 Verify scenario "Inspect and replay by hash" with inspect/replay fixtures; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/artifact-inspect-replay.txt`
- [ ] V3 Verify scenario "Manifest gates authority" with denied-effect fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/ability-manifest-denial.txt`
- [ ] V4 Verify scenario "Replay handler denies unexpected effects" with trace mismatch fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/ability-replay-denial.txt`
- [ ] V5 Verify scenario "Name resolves to immutable hash" with pointer inspect fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/name-resolves-hash.txt`
- [ ] V6 Verify scenario "Pointer update supports rollback" with pointer rollback fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/name-pointer-rollback.txt`
- [ ] V7 Verify scenario "Session records are typed and versioned" with session DTO fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/session-record-versioning.txt`
- [ ] V8 Verify scenario "Migration preserves replay identity" with migration fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/session-migration-identity.txt`
- [ ] V9 Verify scenario "Session todo state is structured" with todo-state export fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/session-todo-structured.txt`
- [ ] V10 Verify scenario "Resolved and unresolved work remain distinguishable" with state transition fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/session-todo-statuses.txt`
- [ ] V11 Verify scenario "Pure cache hit reuses matching result" with cache hit fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/pure-cache-hit.txt`
- [ ] V12 Verify scenario "Environment drift invalidates cache" with cache miss fixture; save output at `openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/pure-cache-env-drift.txt`

## Phase 3: Human/oracle checkpoints

- [ ] H1 Human/oracle checkpoint: command=`review add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap proposal/design/specs against Unison-inspired source concepts and Slotcar Rust/OpenSpec constraints`; input=`openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/proposal.md, design.md, specs/consumer-integration/spec.md, specs/documentation/spec.md, specs/performance/spec.md`; asserts=`scope imports content identity, ability contracts, pointer names, typed sessions, structured todos, and pure caching without copying Unison syntax or runtime semantics`; evidence=`openspec/changes/add-unison-inspired-agent-roadmap/evidence/scope-review.txt`
