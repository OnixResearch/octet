## Phase 1: Implementation

- [x] I1 Extend bounded primitive mechanism contracts and generated artifact export fields for approved APIs, forbidden APIs, capacity witnesses, and backpressure behavior (evidence: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/policy-artifact-export.txt`, `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/focused-checks.txt`)
- [x] I2 Update `tigerstyle-standards` resource checks to consume bounded queue obligations from generated policy artifacts (evidence: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/standards-fixtures.txt`, `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/focused-checks.txt`)
- [x] I3 Add compliant and noncompliant bounded queue structural fixtures (evidence: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/standards-fixtures.txt`)
- [x] I4 Update downstream/Aspen documentation for the hard structural bounded queue gate (evidence: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/focused-checks.txt`)

## Phase 2: Deterministic verification

- [x] V1 Verify scenario "Bounded queue artifact exports checker obligations" with policy artifact export assertions; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/policy-artifact-export.txt`
- [x] V2 Verify scenario "Artifact-backed checker rejects configured unbounded constructors" with standards fixture check; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/standards-fixtures.txt`
- [x] V3 Verify scenario "Bounded construction with witness passes" with standards fixture check; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/standards-fixtures.txt`
- [x] V4 Verify scenario "Missing capacity witness remains a structural finding" with standards fixture check; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/standards-fixtures.txt`
- [x] V5 Verify scenario "Downstream mutation fails the policy artifact consumer check" with Aspen scratch mutation; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/aspen-policy-artifact-mutation.txt`
- [x] V6 Verify focused Rust and Nix checks for the implementation; save output at `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/focused-checks.txt`

## Phase 3: Human/oracle checkpoints

- [x] H1 Human/oracle checkpoint: command=`git -C /home/brittonr/git/aspen status --short --branch`; input=`Aspen checkout after scratch mutation proof`; asserts=`Aspen checkout has no retained mutation from the negative proof`; evidence=`openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-05-enforce-bounded-queue-structural-gate/evidence/aspen-clean-status.txt`
