## Phase 1: Implementation

- [x] I0 [serial] Update delta specs under `openspec/changes/roi-01-openspec-omission-gate-rails/specs/` to capture promoted omission-prevention behavior for stage-authoring and task-governance. ✅ 1m (completed: 2026-05-18T17:44:00Z)
- [x] I1 [serial] Update `openspec/templates/proposal.md`, `openspec/templates/spec.md`, and `openspec/templates/design.md` with omission-prevention prompts for the promoted proposal/spec/design omission classes. ✅ 4m (completed: 2026-05-18T17:32:05Z)
- [x] I2 [serial] Update `openspec/templates/tasks.md` with omission-prevention prompts for split implementation/proof tasks, one-row-per-scenario coverage, and exact `H<n>` replay fields. ✅ 3m (completed: 2026-05-18T17:36:03Z)
- [x] I3 [serial] Update `openspec/config.yaml` stage rules so proposal/spec/design/tasks prompts name the same omission-prevention obligations. ✅ 2m (completed: 2026-05-18T17:37:18Z)
- [x] I4 [serial] Add deterministic evidence helper `openspec/changes/roi-01-openspec-omission-gate-rails/evidence/update-omission-artifacts.py`. ✅ 3m (completed: 2026-05-18T17:38:56Z)

## Change Status
- Status: complete
- Open tasks: none
Use `Open tasks: none` only when every governed `I<n>`, `V<n>`, and `H<n>` task checkbox is checked.
