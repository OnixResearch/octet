## Phase 1: Pilot surface

- [x] I1 Add bounded HIR/MIR supplement DTOs, closed status values, and canonical serialization helpers for selected fixture functions.
- [x] I2 Add pilot supplement emit/check command surface while preserving Function Object v1 as the canonical review/provenance identity.
- [ ] I3 Update object corpus contract metadata so fixture-backed pilot families can report `pilot-supported` and all other HIR/THIR/MIR families remain `unsupported-planned`.
- [ ] I4 Add contributor/operator documentation for the pilot command, replay boundaries, and non-proof language.

## Phase 2: Deterministic verification

- [ ] V1 Verify scenario "Pilot HIR supplement attaches to v1 object identity" with focused cargo-octet fixture tests; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/hir-pilot-attachment.txt`.
- [ ] V2 Verify scenario "Pilot MIR supplement records unsupported summary families" with focused cargo-octet fixture tests; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/mir-pilot-caveats.txt`.
- [ ] V3 Verify scenario "Supplement check fails closed on mismatched context" with negative receipt fixtures; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/supplement-check-negative.txt`.
- [ ] V4 Verify scenario "Unsupported supplement family remains planned" with contract metadata fixture checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/unsupported-remains-planned.txt`.
- [ ] V5 Verify scenario "HIR supplement preserves v1 identity boundary" with docs/output boundary checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/hir-boundary.txt`.
- [ ] V6 Verify scenario "MIR supplement is version and context scoped" with docs/output boundary checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/mir-boundary.txt`.
- [ ] V7 Verify scenario "Supplement metadata fails closed before implementation claims" with contract metadata fixture checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/fail-closed-metadata.txt`.
- [ ] V8 Verify scenario "Contract metadata names planned HIR/MIR supplements" with `cargo octet object corpus contract --output-format json`; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/contract-metadata-planned.txt`.
- [ ] V9 Verify scenario "Planned supplements fail closed before extractor implementation" with unsupported-family negative metadata checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/planned-fail-closed.txt`.
- [ ] V10 Verify scenario "Pilot-supported metadata remains bounded" with contract metadata and contributor docs checks; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/pilot-supported-bounded.txt`.
- [ ] V11 Verify aggregate Valence object evidence with `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.valence-object-evidence --no-link -L`; save output at `openspec/changes/hir-mir-supplement-pilot/evidence/valence-object-evidence.txt`.

## Change Status
