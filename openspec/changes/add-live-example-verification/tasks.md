## Phase 1: Implementation

- [ ] I1 Add live example verification standards documentation and policy classification
- [ ] I2 Add implementation hooks, command contracts, or templates required by the live example verification design

## Phase 2: Deterministic verification

- [ ] V1 Verify scenario "Example links to fixture" with deterministic docs/policy/fixture checks; save output at `openspec/changes/add-live-example-verification/evidence/example-links-to-fixture.txt`
- [ ] V2 Verify scenario "Prose-only example is explicit" with deterministic docs/policy/fixture checks; save output at `openspec/changes/add-live-example-verification/evidence/prose-only-example-is-explicit.txt`
- [ ] V3 Verify scenario "Changed fixture invalidates manifest" with deterministic docs/policy/fixture checks; save output at `openspec/changes/add-live-example-verification/evidence/changed-fixture-invalidates-manifest.txt`

## Phase 3: Human/oracle checkpoints

- [ ] H1 Human/oracle checkpoint: command=`review add-live-example-verification proposal/design/specs against Unison-inspired source concept and Tigerstyle FCIS constraints`; input=`openspec/changes/add-live-example-verification/proposal.md, design.md, specs/documentation/spec.md`; asserts=`scope imports the useful discipline without copying Unison syntax or premature hard gates`; evidence=`openspec/changes/add-live-example-verification/evidence/scope-review.txt`

## Change Status
- Status: in-progress
- Open tasks: I1, I2, V1, V2, V3, H1

## Verification Coverage
