Spec-foundation note: this package defines future implementation and verification work only; no implementation task is complete yet.

## Phase 1: Implementation

- [ ] I1 Extend the policy registry schema/export with current and target enforcement modes plus mechanism metadata.
- [ ] I2 Add Nickel closed contracts for policies, enforcement modes, mechanisms, evidence, suppressions, proof rails, and seed manifests.
- [ ] I3 Add Nickel cross-field validation for structural mode, verified mode, deny severity, suppressions, and proof-relevant seeds.
- [ ] I4 Implement policy validation for unknown modes, missing escalation criteria, missing mechanisms, and invalid fallback declarations.
- [ ] I5 Implement the first structural core/shell checker slice for no-std core declarations, forbidden core effects, and shell-to-core dependency direction.
- [ ] I6 Add capability-constructor validation for approved shell-owned authority wrappers and injected core values.
- [ ] I7 Add type-state and bounded-primitive validation fixtures and checker hooks for configured structural policies.
- [ ] I8 Add verified-mode metadata and proof-rail validation for backend, command, source/proof mapping, pass signal, and trust-boundary accounting.
- [ ] I9 Add reference seed manifest support for optional imports from sibling repositories.
- [ ] I10 Add minimal UCAN-style, verified-logic-style, and Vericoder-style seed fixtures or vendored examples only after manifest validation exists.
- [ ] I11 Update docs, templates, and machine-output metadata to distinguish lint, gate, structural, verified, and human/oracle findings.

## Phase 3: Human/oracle checkpoints

- [ ] H1 Human/oracle checkpoint: command=`manual review of seed manifest and vendored paths before accepting any sibling import`; input=`source commits and manifests for ../vericoder-mvp/, ../verified-logic/, and ../ucan/`; asserts=`license/provenance and role classification are sufficient for every vendored seed`; evidence=`openspec/changes/add-structural-enforcement-modes/evidence/seed-provenance-review.txt`
