## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit Defaults Detection

The lint MUST warn when a call resolves to the `Default` trait's `default`
function and the resulting concrete type is defined in a different crate than
the current crate.

For this rule, sibling workspace crates count as external crates because they
compile as distinct crate identities.

This rule MUST cover these source forms when they resolve to the `Default`
trait implementation:
- `Default::default()`
- `<T as Default>::default()`
- `T::default()`

The lint MUST use resolved trait/function identity rather than path-text string
matching.

The lint MUST NOT fire on types defined in the current crate.

The lint MUST NOT fire in `#[cfg(test)]` contexts.

#### Scenario: External type default

- GIVEN `let config = reqwest::ClientBuilder::default();`
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it warns that the code relies on an implicit default from an external
  crate

#### Scenario: Sibling workspace type default

- GIVEN `let cfg: shared_types::Config = Default::default();` where
  `shared_types` is a different crate in the same workspace
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it warns

#### Scenario: Own type default

- GIVEN `let state = MyState::default();` where `MyState` is defined in the
  current crate
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it does NOT fire

### Requirement: Unbounded Channel Detection

The lint MUST warn on calls whose resolved callee identity is one of these
unbounded channel constructors:
- `std::sync::mpsc::channel`
- `crossbeam::channel::unbounded`
- Tokio's unbounded MPSC constructor, whose resolved definition path is
  `tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded::unbounded_channel`

The lint MUST match by resolved function identity or definition path, not only
by the public re-export spelling that appears in source.

The lint MUST suggest using the bounded alternative with explicit capacity.

#### Scenario: Tokio unbounded channel

- GIVEN `let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel();`
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it warns to use the bounded channel constructor with explicit capacity

#### Scenario: Bounded channel

- GIVEN `let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(100);`
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it does NOT fire

### Requirement: Unbounded Collection Growth In Loops

The lint MUST warn only on narrow same-block cases where:
- a local binding of type `Vec`, `HashMap`, `BTreeMap`, or `VecDeque` is
  initialized empty in the same block
- that same binding is grown with `.push()`, `.insert()`, or `.extend()`
  inside a `loop`, `while`, or `for` body in that same block
- and the same binding has no prior reservation or explicit growth bound that
  makes the loop growth reviewably finite

For this rule, an accepted prior reservation is one of these on the same
binding before the loop-growth site:
- `::with_capacity(...)`
- `reserve(...)`
- `reserve_exact(...)`
- `try_reserve(...)`

The lint MUST NOT fire when dataflow or aliasing is unclear, including bindings
created outside the current block or mutated through a different binding.

The lint MUST NOT fire on collection operations outside loops.

The lint MUST NOT fire when the same binding is guarded by an explicit local
capacity/length bound that makes the growth finite and reviewable.

#### Scenario: Push in loop without capacity

- GIVEN:
  ```rust
  let mut items = Vec::new();
  loop { items.push(read_item()); }
  ```
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it warns that the loop grows the collection without a prior bound or
  reservation

#### Scenario: Reserved before loop

- GIVEN:
  ```rust
  let mut items = Vec::new();
  items.reserve(128);
  while has_more() { items.push(read_item()); }
  ```
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it does NOT fire

#### Scenario: Ambiguous outer binding

- GIVEN a collection binding created outside the current block and later grown
  inside a loop
- WHEN the lint runs
- THEN it does NOT fire
