# standards-codification Specification

## Purpose

This spec defines the Tiger Style standards policy registry, standards-checker command surface, fixture expectations, suppression metadata, verification rails, and naming hygiene needed to keep codified standards traceable to their source material.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Tiger Style Policy Registry

The system MUST maintain a machine-readable Tiger Style policy registry that traces each codification candidate to `docs/standards/source/tigerstyle-standards.adoc` or an included `docs/standards/source/*.adoc` source section.

Each policy entry MUST include a stable `tigerstyle.*` policy ID, pillar, source path, source heading, summary, enforcement level, checker owner, default severity, suppression requirements, and verification evidence requirements.

#### Scenario: Codifiable source becomes policy

- GIVEN a Tiger Style source section states a repeatable rule such as "every unbounded queue is a latent OOM"
- WHEN the policy inventory is generated or updated
- THEN the registry contains a policy entry linked to `docs/standards/source/embedded.adoc`
- AND the entry classifies whether the rule is hard, advisory, or human-process-only
- AND the entry names the checker or planned checker that owns enforcement

#### Scenario: Human-only guidance stays explicit

- GIVEN a Tiger Style source section describes flow protection, regulatory classification, or Five Whys facilitation
- WHEN the policy inventory is reviewed
- THEN the registry marks the entry as human-process-only or advisory
- AND no blocking build rule is created without a separate, measurable enforcement design

#### Scenario: Missing traceability is rejected

- GIVEN a policy entry lacks a source path or source heading
- WHEN the registry is validated
- THEN validation fails with a diagnostic naming the incomplete policy entry

### Requirement: Typed Policy Configuration

The system MUST use typed Nickel contracts for project-owned Tiger Style policy configuration, with generated machine formats used only as tool inputs.

The policy schema MUST reject entries with missing required fields, unknown enforcement levels, missing suppression metadata, or checker references that do not map to a known checker.

#### Scenario: Valid Nickel policy exports for tools

- GIVEN a policy registry that satisfies the Nickel contract
- WHEN the export command runs
- THEN it produces deterministic tool input data
- AND the exported data preserves policy IDs, source links, enforcement levels, and checker ownership

#### Scenario: Invalid policy fails before checks run

- GIVEN a policy entry declares an unknown enforcement level
- WHEN registry validation runs
- THEN the command fails before running source-code checks
- AND the diagnostic identifies the invalid field and policy ID

### Requirement: Reusable Tiger Style Standards Runner

The system MUST provide a reusable `tigerstyle-standards` checker command with a pure rule-evaluation core and a thin imperative shell for filesystem traversal, CLI parsing, and process exit codes.

The runner MUST support selecting rule families, validating fixtures, emitting stable human-readable diagnostics, and producing machine-readable output for CI dashboards.

#### Scenario: Blocking hard rule fails deterministically

- GIVEN a fixture that violates a hard policy
- WHEN the checker runs against that fixture
- THEN the command exits non-zero
- AND the diagnostic includes policy ID, file path, line when available, source section, and remediation summary

#### Scenario: Advisory rule reports without blocking

- GIVEN a fixture that only violates advisory policies
- WHEN the checker runs in default CI mode
- THEN the command exits successfully
- AND the report includes the advisory finding with its policy ID and source section

### Requirement: Hard Rule Families

The system MUST codify high-confidence Tiger Style rules as hard-rule families when the rule can be checked with low false-positive risk and clear remediation.

At minimum, the policy plan MUST cover these hard-rule candidates:

- Architecture: FCIS crate boundary, no external domain type leakage into core, explicit conversion at boundaries, root crate thinness, and controlled public API surface.
- DevTools: single-command verification, deny warnings, formatting enforcement, documentation gates, dependency audit gates, and no unexplained lint suppressions.
- Embedded: bounded channels and queues, timeout-backed blocking I/O, opt-in subsystem startup from a hardware manifest, safe serial APIs, and bounded task/thread topology.
- Resilience: explicit typed errors, no silent defaulting on fallible paths, modeled failure modes instead of catch-all buckets, and fail-closed error handling.
- Orchestration: declarative transition tables, deny-by-default work acceptance, invalid transitions that leave state unchanged, and priority ordering properties.
- Idioms: one behavior / one type extraction candidates, duplicate primitive-behavior detection, and verifier recognition of approved thin-forwarder idiom output.
- Build What You Test: explicit test builders for broad config structs, visible preconditions, no hidden external fixtures in unit tests, and isolated process-global state.
- Metrics: flat telemetry payloads, threshold-backed health checks, Prometheus text exposition when metrics endpoints exist, and BLAKE3 hash-chain audit integrity.
- Verification: positive and negative tests, FIRST properties where statically checkable, target/hardware coverage declarations, and safety-critical evidence prompts.

#### Scenario: Candidate rule with weak signal becomes advisory

- GIVEN a candidate rule cannot distinguish safe code from unsafe code without human context
- WHEN the hard-rule family is reviewed
- THEN the registry classifies it as advisory or human-process-only
- AND the design records why it is not a blocking gate yet

#### Scenario: Hard rule has fixture evidence

- GIVEN a hard-rule policy is enabled
- WHEN fixture validation runs
- THEN at least one passing fixture proves the checker accepts the intended shape
- AND at least one failing fixture proves the checker rejects the unsafe or noncompliant shape

### Requirement: Suppressions and Escape Hatches

The system MUST make any suppression of a Tiger Style hard rule explicit, traceable, and narrow.

Suppressions MUST use `tigerstyle-allow:` and include policy ID, source section, justification, owner, review trigger, and a reference to the safer default being bypassed. Blanket allow-lists that hide future true positives MUST be rejected.

#### Scenario: Narrow suppression is accepted

- GIVEN a hardware-bound module needs a justified exception to a hard rule
- WHEN the suppression includes policy ID, source section, owner, rationale, review trigger, and the safer default being bypassed
- THEN the checker accepts only the annotated location
- AND the report records the active suppression

#### Scenario: Blanket suppression is rejected

- GIVEN a suppression disables a rule across a module or workspace without policy ID and owner
- WHEN the checker runs
- THEN the command fails
- AND the diagnostic points to the suppression rule and remediation format

### Requirement: Verification Rail Integration

The system MUST integrate Tiger Style standards codification with existing verification rails through local-first commands and flake checks.

The command set MUST remain runnable from the Nix dev shell and MUST include standards checker self-tests, policy registry validation, fixture validation, workspace checks, Clippy denial, and Tiger Style lint checks as separate seams.

#### Scenario: Local-first standards verification succeeds

- GIVEN a developer enters the Nix dev shell or invokes `nix develop path:. -c ...`
- WHEN the documented Tiger Style standards verification commands run
- THEN they execute standards self-tests, policy validation, fixture checks, formatting, and workspace checks with repo-local target directories where Cargo artifacts are involved
- AND they exit successfully for a compliant workspace

#### Scenario: Fixture regression blocks CI

- GIVEN a change weakens a checker so a failing fixture is no longer reported
- WHEN fixture validation runs under the flake check
- THEN CI fails with the fixture name, expected policy ID, and missing diagnostic

### Requirement: Rename Hygiene

The system MUST remove legacy project naming from Tiger Style-owned standards artifacts.

The migrated standards source, policy IDs, suppression marker, checker command, docs, Nix apps, and OpenSpec artifacts MUST use Tiger Style naming.

#### Scenario: Legacy project names are absent from Tiger Style standards artifacts

- GIVEN the standards migration is staged in the `tigerstyle` repo
- WHEN a case-insensitive source scan runs over Rust, Markdown, Nickel, AsciiDoc, Nix, TOML, YAML, and text artifacts
- THEN it finds no legacy project strings strings in the migrated Tiger Style standards surface

### Requirement: External Source Incorporation Classification [r[external-source-incorporation-classification]]

The system MUST classify each incorporated external reference concept before it becomes Tigerstyle standards guidance, policy registry data, or lint scope.

Each classification MUST name the external source, the imported concept, the Tiger Style outcome it supports, the enforcement tier, and whether the first implementation is documentation, policy metadata, a checker, or a human checklist.

#### Scenario: External concepts are classified before incorporation [r[external-source-incorporation-classification.scenario.classified-before-incorporation]]

- GIVEN a contributor proposes importing a Valgrind tool-suite concept or a Rust Design Patterns idiom
- WHEN the standards incorporation plan is updated
- THEN the plan records the source URL, selected concept, Tiger Style rationale, and enforcement tier
- AND concepts with weak static signal remain advisory or human-process-only until separate fixture evidence exists

### Requirement: Dynamic Evidence Profiles [r[dynamic-evidence-profiles]]

The system MUST document opt-in dynamic evidence profiles for bug classes that static Tigerstyle lints cannot fully prove.

The profiles MUST cover memory/allocation behavior, cache or hot-path profiling, race/concurrency analysis, unsafe or FFI boundary checking, and release-readiness timing. Each profile MUST state when to run it, the expected acceptance signal, and how evidence is saved for OpenSpec review.

#### Scenario: Dynamic profile guidance names run timing and acceptance signal [r[dynamic-evidence-profiles.scenario.timing-and-acceptance]]

- GIVEN a maintainer selects an unsafe, FFI, concurrency, or performance-sensitive slice
- WHEN the relevant dynamic evidence profile is read
- THEN the profile names the applicable run timing such as after a big change, suspected bug, pre-release, or focused CI rail
- AND it names the acceptance signal or saved transcript shape required for review

#### Scenario: Heavyweight tools remain optional until a profile is selected [r[dynamic-evidence-profiles.scenario.optional-until-selected]]

- GIVEN a normal Tigerstyle consumer runs the default lint or standards checks
- WHEN no dynamic evidence profile is selected
- THEN the default command set does not require Valgrind, sanitizers, heap profilers, cache profilers, Miri, or Loom to be installed
- AND profile docs explain how to run selected tools only for applicable evidence slices

### Requirement: Rust Idiom Guidance [r[rust-idiom-guidance]]

The system MUST provide Tigerstyle-owned Rust idiom guidance that imports only patterns that improve safety, explicitness, boundedness, recoverability, performance evidence, or developer comprehension.

The guidance MUST cover newtypes for units/capabilities/secrets, RAII resource guards, contained unsafe modules, borrowed argument types, temporary mutability, clone-to-satisfy-borrow-checker alternatives, returning consumed arguments on error, constrained builders, command/effects-as-data, FFI wrappers and error mapping, restrained `Deref` use, small-crate boundaries, and functional API patterns that use generics or sealed traits to make invalid protocol/state operations unrepresentable.

#### Scenario: Rust idiom guidance maps each imported pattern to Tiger Style outcomes [r[rust-idiom-guidance.scenario.maps-patterns-to-outcomes]]

- GIVEN a reader opens the Rust idiom guidance
- WHEN they review an imported pattern or anti-pattern
- THEN the guidance states the Tiger Style outcome it supports
- AND it distinguishes immediate documentation/checklist guidance from future lint or policy enforcement

#### Scenario: Future lints require fixtures before hard gating [r[rust-idiom-guidance.scenario.future-lints-require-fixtures]]

- GIVEN a pattern-derived lint candidate such as borrowed argument types, unsafe module containment, clone-avoidance, temporary mutability, or `Deref` restraint is proposed
- WHEN the policy registry classifies it as a hard rule
- THEN positive and negative fixtures prove the intended compliant and noncompliant shapes
- AND the lint is not promoted to a default hard gate without that fixture evidence

### Requirement: Functional API Boundary Guidance [r[functional-api-boundary-guidance]]

The system MUST document which functional programming concepts from Rust Design Patterns are acceptable Tigerstyle guidance and which remain non-goals.

The guidance MUST promote type-class-style generics, sealed traits, associated types, and marker-state APIs when they encode protocol, state, capability, or format differences at compile time. It MUST treat optics, visitors, and prism-like adapter splits as advanced human-review guidance for serialization, traversal, and plugin boundaries rather than default application style. It MUST caution against opaque point-free or deeply chained functional code in hot paths, safety-critical paths, and code that needs dense assertions.

#### Scenario: Functional API guidance promotes type-level state separation without opaque cleverness [r[functional-api-boundary-guidance.scenario.type-level-state-not-cleverness]]

- GIVEN a Tigerstyle guide imports functional programming concepts
- WHEN a reader compares type-class/generic-state APIs, optics/visitor adapter APIs, and fold-heavy declarative code
- THEN the guide recommends type-level state or protocol separation where it removes runtime `Option`/enum checks from known-state code paths
- AND it classifies optics or visitor/prism patterns as advanced boundary tools requiring human design review
- AND it warns that long iterator chains or point-free transformations are inappropriate when they hide bounds, branches, assertions, or hot-loop costs

### Requirement: Function Fingerprint Policy [r[function-fingerprint-policy]]

The system MUST define a Tigerstyle policy for selective content-addressed function fingerprints that bind safety-critical Rust functions to exact reviewed or verified source-token bodies.

The policy MUST state that fingerprints are identity and review gates, not correctness proofs. It MUST recommend fingerprints for verified primitives, protocol transitions, security-sensitive functions, capability/token constructors, safety-critical arithmetic, and fixture-backed documentation examples. It MUST NOT require blanket fingerprints for every function in a workspace.

#### Scenario: Critical function categories are documented [r[function-fingerprint-policy.scenario.critical-categories]]

- GIVEN a maintainer reads the function fingerprint guidance
- WHEN they decide whether a function should be fingerprinted
- THEN the guidance names verified primitives, protocol transitions, security-sensitive functions, capability/token constructors, safety-critical arithmetic, and fixture-backed examples as recommended categories
- AND the guidance says ordinary functions do not need fingerprints by default

#### Scenario: Fingerprints do not claim correctness [r[function-fingerprint-policy.scenario.identity-not-correctness]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted function matches its stored hash
- WHEN the tool reports the fingerprint as valid
- THEN the documentation and diagnostic language state that the exact source body matches the reviewed body
- AND they do not claim the function is semantically correct, safe, or verified solely because the hash matches

### Requirement: Function Fingerprint Metadata [r[function-fingerprint-metadata]]

The system MUST require review metadata for function fingerprints so each selected function records why content identity matters.

At minimum, each fingerprint MUST name the hash value and review class. Supported review classes MUST include `verified`, `protocol-transition`, `security`, `capability-token`, `safety-arithmetic`, and `example-evidence`. Optional metadata MAY include owner, spec ID, evidence path, and macro allowance.

#### Scenario: Missing review class is rejected [r[function-fingerprint-metadata.scenario.missing-review-class]]

- GIVEN a function carries a fingerprint hash but omits review class metadata
- WHEN fingerprint validation runs in strict mode
- THEN validation reports the function as incomplete
- AND the diagnostic names the missing review class field

#### Scenario: Review metadata links to evidence [r[function-fingerprint-metadata.scenario.links-to-evidence]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted verified primitive or protocol transition names a spec ID or evidence path
- WHEN fingerprint inventory output is generated
- THEN the output preserves the function name, hash, review class, and evidence reference
- AND reviewers can trace the function identity to the relevant OpenSpec or verification artifact

### Requirement: Function Fingerprint Hash Semantics [r[function-fingerprint-hash-semantics]]

The system MUST compute function fingerprints from a versioned, domain-separated, normalized representation of Rust function source tokens.

The hash input MUST include normalized visibility, signature, generic parameters, where clauses, and body tokens. It MUST exclude the fingerprint attribute or marker itself, whitespace, comments, file paths, line numbers, timestamps, local usernames, and absolute paths. The hash algorithm MUST be identified with a `b3:` prefix for BLAKE3 values.

#### Scenario: Formatting and comments do not change hash [r[function-fingerprint-hash-semantics.scenario.formatting-stable]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted function whose executable tokens are unchanged
- WHEN only rustfmt layout, comments, or line numbers change
- THEN recomputing the fingerprint yields the same `b3:` value

#### Scenario: Signature or body token changes update hash [r[function-fingerprint-hash-semantics.scenario.token-change-detected]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted function with a stored hash
- WHEN its signature, generics, where clause, visibility, or body tokens change
- THEN fingerprint validation reports a mismatch with expected and actual `b3:` values

### Requirement: Function Fingerprint Macro Boundary [r[function-fingerprint-macro-boundary]]

The system MUST make macro-call limitations explicit for fingerprinted functions.

If a fingerprinted function contains source macro invocations, validation MUST report a macro-boundary warning unless the fingerprint metadata explicitly allows macros. The warning MUST explain that source-token fingerprints do not cover macro definition changes or expansion semantics.

#### Scenario: Macro call warns by default [r[function-fingerprint-macro-boundary.scenario.warns-by-default]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted function body contains a macro invocation
- WHEN fingerprint validation runs
- THEN validation emits a macro-boundary diagnostic
- AND the diagnostic explains that macro definitions are not covered by the function source-token hash

#### Scenario: Explicit macro allowance suppresses caveat [r[function-fingerprint-macro-boundary.scenario.explicit-allowance]]

- GIVEN a fingerprinted function body contains a macro invocation and metadata explicitly allows macros
- WHEN fingerprint validation runs
- THEN validation does not emit the default macro-boundary warning
- AND inventory output preserves that macro allowance for review

### Requirement: Effect Capability Boundary Guidance [r[effect-capability-boundary-guidance]]

The system MUST document a Rust effect-capability boundary model that keeps domain core logic free of ambient IO, time, randomness, env access, process spawning, networking, and remote execution while allowing effects to appear as explicit data or named capability traits.

#### Scenario: Core effects are explicit [r[effect-capability-boundary-guidance-scenario-core-effects-are-explicit]]

- GIVEN a developer designs a core function
- WHEN they consult the guidance
- THEN it describes returning effect descriptions or accepting named capabilities instead of reading ambient state directly

#### Scenario: Shell interprets capabilities [r[effect-capability-boundary-guidance-scenario-shell-interprets-capabilities]]

- GIVEN core logic emits an effect description
- WHEN shell code executes the program
- THEN the shell owns IO, time, randomness, network, process, and remote side effects

### Requirement: Future effect lint classification [r[future-effect-lint-classification]]

The system MUST classify future effect-boundary lint candidates before hard gating them, including effectful globals, effectful constructors, and expanded pure-module checks.

#### Scenario: Lint candidates stay staged [r[future-effect-lint-classification-scenario-lint-candidates-stay-staged]]

- GIVEN an effect-boundary checker has weak static signal
- WHEN policy metadata is reviewed
- THEN the checker remains advisory or human-process-only until positive and negative fixtures prove low false-positive behavior

### Requirement: Top Level Purity Guidance [r[top-level-purity-guidance]]

The system MUST document that Rust globals, static initializers, lazy initializers, constructors, Default implementations, and builders should not hide filesystem, env, clock, randomness, network, process, or spawn effects.

#### Scenario: Initializer side effects are rejected by guidance [r[top-level-purity-guidance-scenario-initializer-side-effects-are-rejected-by-guidance]]

- GIVEN a LazyLock initializer reads env or files
- WHEN a reviewer applies the guidance
- THEN it is classified as shell work or delayed effect construction rather than pure initialization

#### Scenario: Constructors validate only [r[top-level-purity-guidance-scenario-constructors-validate-only]]

- GIVEN a `new`, `default`, or `build` function exists in core logic
- WHEN it is reviewed
- THEN the accepted shape validates and constructs values without performing ambient effects

### Requirement: Delayed Effect Pattern [r[delayed-effect-pattern]]

The system MUST document delayed-effect alternatives such as returning commands, plans, tasks, or capability requests for shell interpretation.

#### Scenario: Effect is represented as data [r[delayed-effect-pattern-scenario-effect-is-represented-as-data]]

- GIVEN construction needs future IO
- WHEN the code follows the delayed-effect pattern
- THEN it returns an explicit effect description and leaves execution to shell code

### Requirement: Remote Execution Effect Contract [r[remote-execution-effect-contract]]

The system MUST document remote execution as a first-class effect family that requires explicit timeout, retry bound, batch bound, idempotency key, and receipt or replay semantics.

#### Scenario: Remote task carries bounds [r[remote-execution-effect-contract-scenario-remote-task-carries-bounds]]

- GIVEN a design schedules remote work
- WHEN the remote effect contract is applied
- THEN the task model names timeout, max retries, idempotency key, and batch bound

#### Scenario: Receipt semantics are explicit [r[remote-execution-effect-contract-scenario-receipt-semantics-are-explicit]]

- GIVEN remote work completes or fails
- WHEN review evidence is captured
- THEN the receipt records enough identity to replay, correlate, or audit the attempted work

### Requirement: Remote Lint Staging [r[remote-lint-staging]]

The system MUST keep remote-effect enforcement advisory or checklist-based until fixtures prove a low false-positive static signal.

#### Scenario: Weak static signal remains human reviewed [r[remote-lint-staging-scenario-weak-static-signal-remains-human-reviewed]]

- GIVEN remote execution APIs differ by consumer
- WHEN a checker is proposed
- THEN the policy records human-process or advisory classification before hard gating

### Requirement: Named Capability Vocabulary [r[named-capability-vocabulary]]

The system MUST document a Rust capability vocabulary pattern for domain effects using explicit traits, tokens, or effect enums with names that expose authority and lifecycle obligations.

#### Scenario: Capability name exposes authority [r[named-capability-vocabulary-scenario-capability-name-exposes-authority]]

- GIVEN code needs clock, entropy, credential, object-store, or remote authority
- WHEN the capability is modeled
- THEN its name and API expose the authority being granted rather than hiding it behind generic context objects

#### Scenario: Core admissibility is explicit [r[named-capability-vocabulary-scenario-core-admissibility-is-explicit]]

- GIVEN a capability crosses into core-adjacent logic
- WHEN it is reviewed
- THEN guidance distinguishes pure data capabilities from shell-only effectful capabilities

### Requirement: Deterministic Capability Handlers [r[deterministic-capability-handlers]]

The system MUST require examples for capability traits to include deterministic test handlers such as fixed clocks, seeded entropy, recording stores, or fake remote executors.

#### Scenario: Test handler avoids ambient state [r[deterministic-capability-handlers-scenario-test-handler-avoids-ambient-state]]

- GIVEN a capability example appears in docs
- WHEN the test form is shown
- THEN it uses deterministic handler state rather than ambient time, randomness, network, or filesystem

### Requirement: Nominal Type Boundary Guidance [r[nominal-type-boundary-guidance]]

The system MUST document when Rust code should use nominal newtypes instead of interchangeable primitive or structural types for IDs, units, secrets, capability tokens, protocol states, and authority-bearing values.

For declared type-state protocol surfaces, the system MUST export structural checker obligations that reject configured raw state aliases and raw transition bypasses while accepting nominal marker-state APIs with visible transition methods.

#### Scenario: Identity values use nominal wrappers [r[nominal-type-boundary-guidance-scenario-identity-values-use-nominal-wrappers]]

- GIVEN a public API accepts an account ID, job ID, token, unit-bearing value, or secret
- WHEN type-boundary guidance is applied
- THEN the API prefers a named wrapper over a raw primitive when confusion would be safety-relevant

#### Scenario: Structural records remain intentional [r[nominal-type-boundary-guidance-scenario-structural-records-remain-intentional]]

- GIVEN two data shapes are intentionally interchangeable plain data
- WHEN structural guidance is applied
- THEN a plain record or tuple remains acceptable with documented interchangeability

#### Scenario: Compliant nominal marker-state API passes [r[nominal-type-boundary-guidance-scenario-compliant-typestate-passes]]

- GIVEN a generated policy artifact declares type-state source scopes, required state marker names, and required transition method names

- THEN the type-state structural policy emits no diagnostics for that compliant source root

#### Scenario: Raw protocol bypass fails structurally [r[nominal-type-boundary-guidance-scenario-raw-protocol-bypass-fails]]

- GIVEN a generated policy artifact declares raw state alias and raw transition bypass patterns
- WHEN `tigerstyle-standards check --policy-artifacts-dir` scans a declared source root containing one of those raw bypasses
- THEN the type-state structural policy emits an error diagnostic naming the configured bypass pattern and exits nonzero when hard policies fail

### Requirement: Primitive Alias Lint Staging [r[primitive-alias-lint-staging]]

The system MUST classify future primitive-alias or missing-newtype lint candidates as staged until fixtures prove that warnings identify safety-relevant ambiguity.

#### Scenario: Primitive lint needs evidence [r[primitive-alias-lint-staging-scenario-primitive-lint-needs-evidence]]

- GIVEN a future checker flags raw IDs or unit values
- WHEN hard-gate promotion is considered
- THEN positive and negative fixtures prove it avoids harmless local primitives

### Requirement: Deterministic Handler Test Guidance [r[deterministic-handler-test-guidance]]

#### Scenario: Handler test is ambient-free [r[deterministic-handler-test-guidance-scenario-handler-test-is-ambient-free]]

- GIVEN a test exercises effect-boundary logic
- WHEN deterministic handler guidance is applied

- GIVEN core code emits effect descriptions
- WHEN a recording handler test runs
- THEN the test can assert the exact ordered effects without performing real side effects

### Requirement: Invalid Path Handler Evidence [r[invalid-path-handler-evidence]]

The system MUST require handler tests to cover invalid paths and cleanup obligations where the effect contract includes failure behavior.

#### Scenario: Failure handler proves cleanup [r[invalid-path-handler-evidence-scenario-failure-handler-proves-cleanup]]

- GIVEN an effect handler can fail after partial progress
- WHEN invalid-path evidence is captured
- THEN the evidence shows the reported error and cleanup or no-mutation behavior

### Requirement: Policy Enforcement Mode Taxonomy [r[policy-enforcement-mode-taxonomy]]

The system MUST let each Tiger Style policy declare a current enforcement mode and target enforcement mode chosen from `lint`, `gate`, `structural`, `verified`, and `human-oracle`.

Each mode declaration MUST name the checker or mechanism responsible for enforcement, the escalation criteria for moving to a stronger mode, and the accepted fallback when a stronger mode is not yet possible.

#### Scenario: Lint-only policy remains explicit [r[policy-enforcement-mode-taxonomy.scenario.lint-only-explicit]]

- GIVEN a Tiger Style policy has useful signal but no reliable structural Rust mechanism
- WHEN the policy registry is validated
- THEN the policy remains valid only if it declares `current = "lint"` or `current = "human-oracle"`
- AND the entry names why structural or verified enforcement is not currently required

#### Scenario: Target mode stronger than current mode records escalation [r[policy-enforcement-mode-taxonomy.scenario.target-escalation-recorded]]

- GIVEN a policy currently gates diagnostics but should eventually become construction-enforced
- WHEN the policy registry is exported
- THEN the exported policy includes both current and target enforcement modes
- AND it includes the fixture or proof evidence required before promotion

### Requirement: Nickel Typed Policy Contracts [r[nickel-typed-policy-contracts]]

The system MUST define Tiger Style policy configuration in Nickel with typed, closed contracts for policies, enforcement modes, mechanisms, evidence, suppressions, proof rails, and reference seed manifests.

The Nickel source MUST be the authoring surface for policy intent and MUST export deterministic machine data consumed by Rust checkers; Rust checkers MUST NOT treat ad-hoc TOML, JSON, or CLI flags as the source of policy truth when a Nickel policy export exists.

#### Scenario: Closed Nickel policy contract rejects unknown fields [r[nickel-typed-policy-contracts.scenario.closed-contract-rejects-unknown-fields]]

- GIVEN a policy entry contains an undeclared field or misspelled enforcement mode
- WHEN Nickel policy validation runs
- THEN validation fails before source-code checkers run
- AND the diagnostic names the invalid policy entry and field

#### Scenario: Structural mode requires structural mechanism contract [r[nickel-typed-policy-contracts.scenario.structural-requires-mechanism]]

- GIVEN a policy declares `current = 'structural`
- WHEN Nickel cross-field validation evaluates the policy
- THEN the policy is valid only if `mechanism.kind` is one of `crate_boundary`, `capability_api`, `bounded_primitive`, `typestate`, or `seed_corpus`

- WHEN Nickel cross-field validation evaluates the policy
- THEN the policy is valid only if a deterministic checker command and expected evidence signal are configured
- AND suppressions, when allowed, require policy ID, source section, owner, rationale, review trigger, and safer default metadata

### Requirement: Nickel Mechanism Contracts [r[nickel-mechanism-contracts]]

The system MUST define mechanism-specific Nickel contracts for crate boundaries, capability APIs, bounded primitives, type-state protocols, proof rails, and seed corpora.

Mechanism contracts MUST include the fields needed by Rust checkers to validate the corresponding structural or verified claim without inferring policy intent from prose.

For bounded primitive mechanisms, the exported contract MUST include approved bounded APIs or wrapper scopes, forbidden unbounded APIs, capacity-witness requirements, and backpressure or overflow behavior requirements.

For type-state mechanisms, Nickel contracts MUST support deterministic exported fields for source scopes, raw state alias patterns, raw transition patterns, required state marker names, and required transition method names.

#### Scenario: Bounded queue artifact exports checker obligations [r[nickel-mechanism-contracts.scenario.bounded-queue-artifact-obligations]]

- GIVEN `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues` declares `mechanism.kind = 'bounded_primitive`
- WHEN generated policy artifacts are exported
- THEN the bounded queue policy artifact includes forbidden unbounded constructors, approved bounded constructors or wrapper scopes, required capacity-witness fields, and required backpressure or overflow behavior fields
- AND the artifact preserves `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues` as the policy ID consumed by `tigerstyle-standards check --policy-artifacts-dir`

#### Scenario: Type-state obligations export deterministically [r[nickel-mechanism-contracts-scenario-type-state-obligations-export]]

- GIVEN the policy registry declares a `type-state` mechanism for nominal type boundaries
- WHEN generated policy artifacts are exported from the Nickel registry
- THEN the policy JSON and checker config include the configured type-state source scopes, raw bypass patterns, state marker names, and transition method names

### Requirement: Structural Mechanism Validation [r[structural-mechanism-validation]]

The system MUST validate claimed structural enforcement mechanisms before accepting a policy as structurally enforced.

Structural validation MUST cover at least no-std core crates, shell-only side effects, approved capability constructors, bounded primitive use, type-state protocol surfaces, and crate dependency direction.

For bounded queue policies, structural validation MUST reject configured unbounded queue constructors in selected source roots and MUST accept only approved bounded constructors or wrappers with explicit capacity and backpressure witnesses.

For effect capability policies, structural validation MUST reject configured ambient authority APIs in declared core source scopes while accepting shell-owned constructors and injected capability or effect-data APIs.

For type-state protocol policies, structural validation MUST reject configured raw state aliases and raw transition shortcuts in declared source scopes while accepting nominal marker-state wrappers with declared transition methods.

#### Scenario: Artifact-backed checker rejects configured unbounded constructors [r[structural-mechanism-validation.scenario.bounded-queue-rejects-unbounded-constructors]]

- GIVEN a generated policy artifact for `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues` lists Tokio, Crossbeam, or std unbounded channel constructors as forbidden APIs
- WHEN `tigerstyle-standards check --policy-artifacts-dir <dir> --family embedded` scans a source root containing one configured unbounded constructor
- THEN the checker exits non-zero
- AND the diagnostic includes policy ID `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues`, structural enforcement mode, bounded primitive mechanism, source path, line when available, and remediation to use an explicit bounded queue with backpressure

#### Scenario: Bounded construction with witness passes [r[structural-mechanism-validation.scenario.bounded-queue-witness-passes]]

- GIVEN source code constructs queues only through approved bounded APIs or approved wrapper scopes
- AND each construction has an explicit capacity constant, capacity argument, or configured wrapper witness plus backpressure or overflow behavior
- WHEN the artifact-backed embedded structural checker scans the source root
- THEN the checker reports zero bounded queue diagnostics
- AND policy evaluation metadata still records that `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues` was evaluated as a structural bounded primitive policy

#### Scenario: Missing capacity witness remains a structural finding [r[structural-mechanism-validation.scenario.bounded-queue-missing-witness-fails]]

- GIVEN source code hides queue construction behind a wrapper or helper that does not expose a configured capacity witness or backpressure behavior
- WHEN the artifact-backed embedded structural checker scans the source root
- THEN the checker reports a structural finding for `tigerstyle.embedded.bounded-queues`
- AND the remediation names the missing capacity or backpressure witness rather than reporting a generic lint failure

#### Scenario: Downstream mutation fails the policy artifact consumer check [r[structural-mechanism-validation.scenario.bounded-queue-downstream-mutation-fails]]

- GIVEN Aspen pins a Tigerstyle flake exposing `lib.mkPolicyArtifactConsumerCheck` and checks selected embedded roots with `checks.x86_64-linux.octet-policy-artifacts`

#### Scenario: Known capability appears in output [r[slotcar-effect-capability-mapping-validation.scenario.known-capability-output]]

- GIVEN a lint finding is mapped to the `time` or `filesystem` capability family
- WHEN JSON, SARIF, or human summary output is generated
- THEN the output includes the mapped capability family
- AND effect summaries count the finding under that family

#### Scenario: Unknown capability is visible [r[slotcar-effect-capability-mapping-validation.scenario.unknown-capability-visible]]

- GIVEN a new lint has no capability-family mapping
- WHEN policy validation or summary output runs
- THEN the result reports an explicit unknown capability status
- AND the unknown status is not omitted from effect summaries

### Requirement: Slotcar Review Identity Registry [r[slotcar-review-identity-registry]]

The system MUST support a review identity registry that maps mutable human-readable review labels, evidence aliases, policy names, and fingerprint manifest handles to immutable content-addressed targets.

#### Scenario: Missing identity is diagnosed [r[slotcar-review-identity-diagnostics.scenario.missing-identity]]

- GIVEN a fingerprint review manifest names a registry label that does not exist
- WHEN strict review identity validation runs
- THEN validation fails with the missing label and expected target kind
- AND the diagnostic names the manifest entry that referenced it

#### Scenario: Identity match avoids correctness claim [r[slotcar-review-identity-diagnostics.scenario.no-correctness-claim]]

- GIVEN a review identity pointer resolves and the fingerprint hash matches
- WHEN human or machine output is generated
- THEN the output states that the reviewed identity and source body match
- AND it does not state that the function is correct, safe, or verified solely because the identity matches

### Requirement: Octet-owned function object v1

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.function_object_v1] Octet MUST emit deterministic function-object v1 records for selected Rust functions as source-token review/provenance identities with explicit schema, normalization, toolchain, body hash, signature hash, object hash, source span, semantic id, and caveats.

#### Scenario: Emit source-token function object

- GIVEN a selected Rust function accepted by Octet's fingerprint scanner
- WHEN the user requests a function-object v1 record
- THEN Octet emits canonical JSON containing the schema id, semantic id, source span, body hash, signature hash, normalization version, toolchain identity, object hash, and caveats declaring source-token identity.

#### Scenario: Reject correctness overclaim

- GIVEN a function-object v1 record whose hashes match current source
- WHEN Octet renders JSON, human output, or review text for that object
- THEN the output describes the object as review/provenance evidence and not as a proof of behavioral correctness or semantic equivalence.

#### Scenario: Real-code corpus emits stable source objects

- GIVEN a bounded corpus of Octet's real Rust implementation modules
- WHEN Octet emits function-object v1 records across that corpus twice
- THEN the emitted object set is deterministic, covers many real functions, preserves per-file source paths, reports caveat distribution, and keeps correctness claims false.

### Requirement: Canonical object hashing

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.canonical_hash] Octet MUST compute object hashes with BLAKE3 over deterministic canonical object content that excludes self-referential hash fields and ambient entropy.

#### Scenario: Same logical object hashes the same across roots

- GIVEN the same logical selected function emitted from two different repository root paths
- WHEN Octet computes the function-object v1 hash
- THEN display-only path differences do not change the hash input and the object hashes match.

#### Scenario: Entropy-bearing fields are excluded or rejected

- GIVEN object fields derived from timestamps, temporary absolute paths, environment variables, or process-local state
- WHEN Octet prepares canonical hash input
- THEN those fields are either excluded as display metadata or rejected as non-canonical hash material.

### Requirement: Object marker compatibility

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.object_markers] Octet MUST support inline object markers that bind selected Rust functions to function-object hashes while preserving existing fingerprint marker workflows.

#### Scenario: Object marker check detects drift

- GIVEN a function with an inline object marker referencing a prior object hash
- WHEN the function body, signature, or caveat-relevant context changes
- THEN Octet check reports drift and requires an explicit update before the object is considered reviewed.

#### Scenario: Existing fingerprint workflows remain usable

- GIVEN a repository that only uses existing Octet function fingerprint markers
- WHEN object support is added
- THEN existing fingerprint check, write, update, and diff workflows continue to work without requiring object markers.

### Requirement: Name pointer registry

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.name_pointers] Octet MUST support a deterministic name-pointer manifest that maps mutable Rust semantic names to immutable object hashes and records pointer movement metadata.

#### Scenario: Pointer move records old and new identity

- GIVEN a name pointer for `crate::module::function` that references an old object hash
- WHEN the user moves that pointer to a new object hash
- THEN Octet records the old hash, new hash, semantic name, diff summary, and rollback handle in deterministic output.

#### Scenario: Pointer references must resolve

- GIVEN a name-pointer manifest and an object bundle
- WHEN Octet validates the manifest
- THEN every pointer hash resolves to a present object record or validation fails closed.

### Requirement: Structured dependency and effect caveats

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.caveats] Octet MUST emit machine-readable dependency, macro, generated-code, and effect caveats using closed status values that distinguish source-token scanning from future HIR/MIR evidence.

#### Scenario: Source-scanned dependencies are not reported as resolved

- GIVEN a function-object v1 record produced by the source scanner
- WHEN Octet emits dependency metadata
- THEN the dependency status uses a source-scanner status and does not claim rustc/HIR-resolved dependency identity.

#### Scenario: Unknown effects block pure-cache eligibility

- GIVEN a function object with unknown, macro-hidden, generated, or unresolved effect sources
- WHEN Octet emits a pure-cache eligibility summary
- THEN the object is reported as ineligible unless stronger reviewed evidence is present.

### Requirement: Object diff

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.object_diff] Octet MUST provide object-aware diffs that report body, signature, dependency caveat, effect caveat, macro caveat, and name-pointer changes separately.

#### Scenario: Diff separates body and caveat changes

- GIVEN old and new function-object records for the same semantic name
- WHEN Octet compares them
- THEN the diff reports whether body hash, signature hash, dependency caveats, effect caveats, macro caveats, or pointer targets changed as separate fields.

### Requirement: Export bundle

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.export_bundle] Octet MUST export deterministic evidence bundles for downstream tools containing object records, name pointers, review manifests, caveat summaries, and replay metadata.

#### Scenario: Bundle membership is deterministic

- GIVEN a set of selected function objects and name pointers
- WHEN Octet exports a bundle
- THEN bundle membership and manifest ordering are deterministic and the bundle hash is stable for the same logical content.

#### Scenario: Bundle records replay command

- GIVEN an exported bundle

- THEN the metadata records the Octet command, relevant config/normalization versions, and input selection needed to reproduce the bundle.

#### Scenario: Real-code corpus bundle is deterministic

- GIVEN function objects emitted from a bounded corpus of Octet's real Rust implementation modules
- WHEN Octet exports the corpus bundle repeatedly
- THEN the bundle bytes, object count, bundle hash, and replay command are stable for the same corpus selection.

### Requirement: Real-code harness hardening

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.real_code_harness] Octet MUST provide a repeatable real-code harness for function-object emission, caveat summaries, negative case classification, and bundle determinism before adding compiler IR-derived evidence.

#### Scenario: Repeatable real-code harness emits classified summary

- GIVEN a named corpus manifest of Octet implementation source files
- WHEN the harness emits function-object v1 records repeatedly
- THEN it compares stable object output, reports object count, source-path coverage, macro/effect caveat distribution, pure-cache blocking, and no-correctness-overclaim status.

#### Scenario: Negative corpus cases are classified

- GIVEN fixture mutations for body changes, comment/formatting-only changes, macro-heavy functions, missing pointers, and unresolved bundle pointers
- WHEN the harness runs those cases
- THEN it proves expected hash stability or drift and fails closed with classified caveat or missing-object outcomes.

#### Scenario: Harness bundle export is deterministic

- GIVEN objects emitted from the named real-code corpus
- WHEN the harness exports bundles repeatedly
- THEN bundle bytes, object count, pointer count, bundle hash, and replay command are stable, and unresolved pointer manifests fail closed.

#### Scenario: Strong local determinism receipt

- GIVEN a scrubbed local environment, multiple fresh target directories, a copied corpus root, and permuted corpus input order
- WHEN the harness emits objects and bundles ten times
- THEN the receipt records binary, toolchain, system, corpus file hashes, stable emit byte hash, stable bundle byte hash, cross-root object-set equivalence, and input-order object-set equivalence.

### Requirement: Compiler IR evidence roadmap

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.compiler_ir] Octet MUST treat future HIR, THIR, and MIR evidence as supplemental compiler-version-coupled evidence layers that improve dependency/effect summaries without replacing function-object v1 review identity.

#### Scenario: HIR evidence is toolchain scoped

- GIVEN a future object containing HIR-derived dependency evidence
- WHEN Octet emits that evidence
- THEN the record includes rustc/toolchain identity, extractor version, resolved dependency summary, and unresolved or macro-origin caveats.

#### Scenario: MIR evidence does not claim cross-version stability

- GIVEN a future object containing MIR-derived call, panic, drop, async, or unsafe summaries
- WHEN Octet emits that evidence
- THEN the record identifies the exact rustc/toolchain and avoids claiming stability across compiler versions.

### Requirement: Downstream evidence boundaries

r[content_addressed_rust_evidence.downstream_boundaries] Octet MUST define downstream evidence boundaries for Valence, Cairn, Trellis, Crunch/Mantle, and Aspen that preserve Octet as the Rust extraction/object source while avoiding claims owned by those systems.

#### Scenario: Cairn consumes Octet receipts without owning extraction

- GIVEN an Octet export bundle receipt
- WHEN Cairn consumes it
- THEN Cairn validates lifecycle/replay policy around the receipt while Octet remains the authority for Rust extraction and object emission.

#### Scenario: Crunch and Aspen pilots remain bounded

- GIVEN Crunch/Mantle or Aspen consumes Octet evidence objects
- WHEN Octet describes the interop contract
- THEN the contract identifies checker/config/source/executor hashes as evidence identity and does not claim build correctness or distributed execution correctness from Octet hashes alone.

### Requirement: Function Object Internal Corpus Pilot [r[function-object-internal-corpus-pilot]]

The system MUST support an Octet-internal function-object corpus pilot that emits deterministic machine-readable receipt summaries for a bounded set of Octet Rust source files.

The receipt MUST include the selected source paths, object count, deterministic object-set hash, caveat distribution, pure-cache blocking count, replay command, and an explicit boundary statement that the receipt is review/provenance evidence rather than a correctness or semantic-equivalence proof.

#### Scenario: Expanded internal corpus emits a deterministic receipt

- GIVEN a bounded Octet source corpus broader than the original object/fingerprint/CLI three-file pilot
- WHEN the corpus receipt command runs twice against the same inputs
- THEN both JSON receipts are byte-identical
- AND the receipt records all selected source paths and an object count greater than the original three-file pilot threshold

#### Scenario: Receipt preserves no-correctness boundary

- GIVEN the internal object corpus contains functions with unresolved dependency, effect, or macro caveats
- WHEN the corpus receipt is emitted
- THEN the receipt reports caveat counts and pure-cache blockers
- AND it states that object hashes are review/provenance evidence, not correctness proofs or semantic equivalence proofs

### Requirement: Function Object Corpus Receipt Check [r[function-object-corpus-receipt-check]]

The system MUST support replaying a saved function-object corpus receipt against selected Rust source inputs and reporting whether the current evidence identity still matches the saved receipt.

The check MUST compare receipt-critical evidence fields, including schema, object count, selected source paths, object-set hash, caveat counts, pure-cache blocker count, and no-correctness/no-semantic-equivalence boundary fields. The check MUST fail closed on drift, malformed receipts, unsupported schema, unsupported schema versions, missing required fields, invalid source selections, empty corpora, or boundary tampering.

Invalid receipt or selection failures MUST emit a deterministic `object corpus check` report with `status = "invalid"` and typed errors when JSON or human output is requested. These failure reports MUST preserve the boundary that receipt checks validate review/provenance evidence identity only; they MUST NOT claim behavioral correctness, semantic equivalence, or cross-machine determinism.

Object corpus receipt checks MUST preserve named compatibility fixture coverage for accepted v1 receipts and fail-closed malformed/tampered receipt or source-selection examples without changing the v1 receipt schema.

#### Scenario: Saved receipt replays cleanly

- GIVEN a saved function-object corpus receipt for selected Rust source files
- WHEN the corpus check command is run with the same source inputs
- THEN the command exits successfully
- AND the report marks schema, object count, source paths, object-set hash, caveat counts, pure-cache blocker count, and boundary fields as matching

#### Scenario: Source drift fails the receipt check

- GIVEN a saved function-object corpus receipt
- WHEN a selected source function changes before the check is rerun
- THEN the command exits non-zero
- AND the report identifies at least the object-set hash drift without claiming semantic equivalence

#### Scenario: Boundary tampering fails the receipt check

- GIVEN a saved corpus receipt whose no-correctness or no-semantic-equivalence boundary was altered
- WHEN the corpus check command is run
- THEN the command exits non-zero
- AND the report identifies boundary drift

#### Scenario: Malformed receipt emits typed invalid report

- GIVEN a saved receipt file that is not valid JSON
- WHEN the corpus check command is run with JSON output
- THEN the command exits non-zero
- AND the report has `status = "invalid"` with an `invalid-json` error kind

#### Scenario: Unsupported schema is rejected before comparison

- GIVEN a saved receipt with an unknown schema or future schema version

### Requirement: Internal Object Corpus Gate

The system MUST provide a checked-in gate fixture and deterministic replay test for Octet's bounded internal function-object corpus.

The gate MUST compare the saved receipt against current selected source inputs using `cargo octet object corpus check --output-format json`, and it MUST preserve the boundary that matching object corpus receipts validate review/provenance evidence identity only.

#### Scenario: Checked-in internal corpus receipt replays cleanly

- GIVEN a checked-in internal object corpus receipt fixture for the bounded Octet source corpus
- WHEN the gate replays the fixture against current selected source paths
- THEN the gate exits successfully and every receipt-critical comparison reports `match`

#### Scenario: Internal corpus gate preserves evidence-only boundaries

- GIVEN the checked-in corpus receipt and replay report
- WHEN the gate inspects the boundary comparison
- THEN the report preserves `claims_correctness = false` and `claims_semantic_equivalence = false` without claiming behavioral correctness or semantic equivalence

#### Scenario: Fixture refresh is deterministic

- GIVEN the checked-in internal corpus receipt fixture
- WHEN a fresh receipt is generated from the same bounded source corpus
- THEN the fresh receipt bytes match the checked-in fixture or the review must include an intentional fixture update

### Requirement: Octet Evidence File Format Contract

Octet MUST distinguish human review artifacts from machine receipt artifacts for content-addressed Rust evidence and define the supported format role for each artifact class.

#### Scenario: Rust DTO owns emitted receipt shape

- GIVEN an emitted Octet evidence receipt family consumed by Octet tests, CI, Cairn, or downstream reviewers
- WHEN the receipt shape is validated for compatibility
- THEN the Rust DTO and serializer behavior MUST be the runtime source of truth
- AND compatibility changes MUST be versioned rather than inferred only from `.json` file names.

#### Scenario: Nickel metadata tracks compatibility policy

- GIVEN an Octet evidence receipt family that becomes compatibility-relevant across tools or policies
- WHEN repository policy describes the family
- THEN the receipt family MUST be registered as Rust-derived, Nickel-authored, or non-candidate in Nickel contract/catalog metadata
- AND hand-authored JSON schema MUST NOT become the normative compatibility source when it can drift from the Rust DTO.

### Requirement: Canonical Serialization Format Boundaries

Octet MUST preserve deterministic canonical serialization rules for current JSON receipts while allowing future additive encodings only when they retain schema identity, hash boundaries, and reviewable summaries.

#### Scenario: JSON hash material is canonical and bounded

- GIVEN a deterministic JSON Octet receipt with object, corpus, bundle, or check hash fields
- WHEN hash material is computed or validated
- THEN self-referential hash fields and ambient host entropy MUST be excluded from hash material
- AND sorted deterministic content MUST be used for portable evidence hashes.

#### Scenario: Future binary format is additive

- GIVEN a future canonical binary or packed evidence bundle format for Octet receipts
- WHEN the format is introduced
- THEN it MUST be additive to the v1 JSON review surface unless a later migration change explicitly replaces that surface
- AND it MUST provide schema identity, compatibility rules, deterministic hashes, and human-reviewable summaries.

### Requirement: File Format Non-Claims

Octet MUST require content-addressed evidence file-format receipts to preserve explicit evidence-only boundaries and reject correctness or semantic-equivalence claims derived only from artifact format or hash agreement.

#### Scenario: File format does not prove correctness

- GIVEN a Markdown narrative, JSON receipt, or future binary bundle whose hashes validate
- WHEN Octet or a downstream consumer reports the artifact status
- THEN the report MUST state or preserve that hash agreement is evidence/provenance identity, not a behavioral correctness proof.

#### Scenario: File format does not prove semantic equivalence

- GIVEN two receipts or bundles that share matching object/corpus hash fields
- WHEN the artifacts are compared
- THEN the comparison MUST NOT claim Rust semantic equivalence solely from matching file-format encodings or hashes.

### Requirement: Function Object Corpus Contract Metadata [r[function-object-corpus-contract-metadata]]

Octet MUST expose Rust-derived contract metadata for `octet.function-object-corpus-receipt.v1` and its corpus check report so review and CI can verify schema names, schema versions, required fields, compared fields, and boundary non-claims without treating JSON files as the source of truth.

#### Scenario: Fresh target bounded non-claims

- GIVEN the generated fresh-target receipts
- WHEN the boundary fields are inspected
- THEN `claims_correctness` and `claims_semantic_equivalence` remain false and the evidence is described as bounded local repeatability rather than cross-machine or semantic proof

### Requirement: Function Object Corpus CI Gate [r[function-object-corpus-ci-gate]]

Octet MUST expose a named CI/check target for the internal function object corpus evidence gate so fixture replay, fixture freshness, Rust-derived contract metadata compatibility, and fresh-target receipt determinism can be run without rediscovering individual test names.

- THEN each check report MUST return `status=invalid`
- AND each report MUST include the expected typed error kind
- AND comparisons MUST remain empty for invalid fixtures

### Requirement: Expanded internal object corpus taxonomy

Octet MUST maintain an expanded internal object corpus taxonomy that selects stable in-repository Rust source modules beyond `cargo-octet/src/*.rs`, records the selected paths in a checked-in fixture, and validates a deterministic object corpus receipt for that expanded source set while preserving bounded evidence claims.

- GIVEN the expanded internal object corpus taxonomy fixture
- WHEN the taxonomy is inspected by tests
- THEN it names the selected source paths from both the `cargo-octet` and `slotcar-standards` buckets

#### Scenario: Fresh-build rail preserves bounded non-proof claims

- GIVEN a fresh-build generated object corpus receipt
- WHEN the rail inspects the receipt boundary fields

#### Scenario: Contributor guide names the fresh-build replay check

- GIVEN contributors need to replay fresh-build object corpus evidence locally
- WHEN they read the contributor guide
- THEN it names `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.fresh-build-object-corpus-determinism --no-link -L` and preserves bounded local non-proof language

### Requirement: HIR/MIR object evidence supplement contract

Octet MUST define HIR/MIR object evidence as optional, toolchain-scoped supplements to `function-object-v1` rather than replacements for source-token object identity. For the bounded pilot, any emitted supplement MUST be attached to a selected Function Object v1 object, MUST include exact toolchain/extractor/schema identity, and MUST include explicit caveats for every unsupported or incomplete evidence family.

#### Scenario: HIR supplement preserves v1 identity boundary

- GIVEN a Function Object v1 record with source-token object identity
- WHEN a pilot HIR evidence supplement is attached to that object
- THEN the supplement records its rustc/toolchain identity, extractor identity, schema version, and extraction caveats
- AND the Function Object v1 `object_hash` remains a review/provenance identity rather than a correctness or semantic-equivalence proof

#### Scenario: MIR supplement is version and context scoped

- GIVEN a pilot MIR evidence supplement for an object
- WHEN the supplement records MIR-derived observations
- THEN it records the rustc version, extractor identity, MIR context or optimization assumptions, and unsupported-context caveats
- AND it does not claim cross-toolchain stability, behavioral correctness, or semantic equivalence from matching MIR evidence

#### Scenario: Supplement metadata fails closed before implementation claims

- GIVEN Octet has not implemented a HIR, THIR, or MIR extractor for a requested evidence family with deterministic fixture evidence
- WHEN contract metadata or operator documentation describes HIR/MIR evidence support
- THEN it reports the family as planned or unsupported rather than silently emitting partial support
- AND any future implementation must add deterministic fixture evidence before claiming support

### Requirement: HIR/MIR supplement contract metadata

Octet MUST expose HIR/MIR supplemental evidence families in object corpus contract metadata with closed support statuses. Families without deterministic extractor fixtures MUST remain `unsupported-planned`; bounded pilot families with positive and negative fixture evidence MAY report `pilot-supported` while preserving toolchain-scoped non-proof boundaries.

#### Scenario: Contract metadata names planned HIR/MIR supplements

- GIVEN `cargo octet object corpus contract --output-format json`
- WHEN the contract metadata is inspected

- AND the family records an unsupported reason and required deterministic fixture evidence before support can be claimed

#### Scenario: Pilot-supported metadata remains bounded

- GIVEN a supplement family has deterministic positive and negative pilot fixtures
- WHEN contract metadata reports that family as `pilot-supported`
- THEN it names the exact schema, toolchain scope, extractor identity expectations, required receipt/check fields, and fixture replay command
- AND it states the pilot is bounded supplement evidence, not correctness, semantic-equivalence, pure-cache, cross-toolchain, or exhaustive Rust coverage proof

### Requirement: Internal corpus caveat taxonomy report

- GIVEN selected internal corpus source paths with dependency, effect, macro, or pure-cache blockers
- WHEN Octet emits the caveat taxonomy report
- THEN each source bucket reports object count, caveat counts, pure-cache blocked count, and blocker names deterministically.

#### Scenario: Caveat taxonomy preserves non-proof boundaries
- GIVEN an object corpus caveat taxonomy report
- WHEN boundary fields are inspected
- THEN `claims_correctness` and `claims_semantic_equivalence` remain false and the report does not claim pure-cache eligibility or semantic equivalence.

### Requirement: Aggregate Valence Object Evidence Gate [r[aggregate-valence-object-evidence-gate]]

The system MUST provide a named Nix check that aggregates Octet's selected Valence object-evidence rails for operator and CI use.

The aggregate gate MUST compose the checked-in internal object corpus replay rail, object corpus compatibility fixture rail, object corpus caveat taxonomy rail, and bounded local fresh-build object corpus determinism rail. It MUST preserve the existing non-proof boundaries: object evidence identifies reviewed evidence/provenance bytes and replay inputs, not behavioral correctness, semantic equivalence, pure-cache eligibility, exhaustive Rust coverage, or cross-machine/cross-toolchain determinism.

#### Scenario: Aggregate gate composes object evidence rails

- GIVEN a maintainer invokes the aggregate Valence object evidence Nix check
- WHEN the check evaluates and builds
- THEN it depends on the object corpus replay, compatibility, caveat taxonomy, and fresh-build determinism rails
- AND it exits successfully only when all composed rails succeed

#### Scenario: Contributor docs name the aggregate command and boundaries

- GIVEN a contributor reads the contributor guide
- WHEN they look for Valence object-evidence verification
- THEN the guide names the aggregate Nix check command
- AND it states the aggregate gate is bounded evidence replay rather than a correctness, semantic-equivalence, exhaustive-coverage, or cross-machine determinism proof

### Requirement: HIR/MIR supplement pilot [r[hir-mir-supplement-pilot]]

Octet MUST support a bounded, fixture-backed HIR/MIR supplement pilot for selected Function Object v1 records. Pilot supplement records MUST reference the canonical `octet.function-object.v1` object hash, record exact toolchain and extractor identity, emit closed schema/status values, and preserve no-correctness/no-semantic-equivalence boundaries.

#### Scenario: Pilot HIR supplement attaches to v1 object identity [r[hir-mir-supplement-pilot.scenario.hir-attaches-v1]]

- GIVEN a selected fixture function with an emitted Function Object v1 record
- WHEN Octet emits a pilot HIR supplement for that function
- THEN the supplement references the v1 `object_hash`, source path, and function name
- AND it records rustc/toolchain identity, extractor name/version, HIR supplement schema version, and unresolved dependency or macro-origin caveats
- AND it does not replace the v1 object hash as review/provenance identity

- GIVEN a selected fixture function where only some MIR summary families are supported by the pilot extractor
- WHEN Octet emits a pilot MIR supplement
- THEN the supplement records rustc/toolchain identity, extractor name/version, MIR supplement schema version, and supported call/panic/drop/async/unsafe/allocation/effect summaries where available
- AND every absent or incomplete summary family is represented by an explicit unknown or unsupported caveat
- AND the output does not claim cross-toolchain stability, behavioral correctness, semantic equivalence, or pure-cache eligibility

#### Scenario: Supplement check fails closed on mismatched context [r[hir-mir-supplement-pilot.scenario.check-fails-closed]]

- GIVEN a saved pilot supplement receipt whose object hash, source path, toolchain identity, extractor version, or schema version differs from the current extraction context
- WHEN Octet checks the receipt against the current fixture input
- THEN the check fails with a deterministic mismatch report naming the compared field
- AND the report preserves the no-correctness and no-semantic-equivalence boundary fields

#### Scenario: Unsupported supplement family remains planned [r[hir-mir-supplement-pilot.scenario.unsupported-remains-planned]]

- GIVEN a HIR, THIR, or MIR supplement family without deterministic checked-in fixture evidence
- WHEN contract metadata or operator documentation describes that family
- THEN its status remains `unsupported-planned`
- AND the metadata names the required fixture evidence before support can be claimed

### Requirement: Rustc-backed HIR extractor spike [r[rustc-hir-extractor-spike]]

Octet MUST provide bounded, fixture-backed rustc HIR extractor spike evidence for selected Function Object v1 records while preserving the v1 object hash as the canonical review/provenance identity. Each supported HIR spike fixture shape MUST be a checked-in, explicitly selected fixture with exact rustc/toolchain identity, extractor identity, schema version, fixture context, observation hash, and explicit non-proof boundaries.

#### Scenario: Second HIR fixture shape attaches to Function Object v1

- GIVEN a second checked-in Rust fixture function with a branch or control-flow shape and an emitted `octet.function-object.v1` record
- WHEN Octet emits rustc-backed HIR spike evidence for that named fixture shape
- THEN the HIR evidence references the existing Function Object v1 `object_hash`, source path, and function name
- AND it records exact rustc/toolchain identity, extractor name/version, schema version, fixture-shape context, observation hash, and extraction caveats
- AND it does not replace the v1 object hash as review/provenance identity

#### Scenario: Second HIR fixture replay fails closed on shape mismatch

- GIVEN a saved rustc-backed HIR spike receipt for one supported fixture shape
- WHEN the receipt is checked against a different supported fixture shape, source path, function name, rustc/toolchain identity, extractor identity, schema version, or observation hash
- THEN replay fails with a deterministic mismatch report naming the compared field
- AND the report preserves no-correctness, no-semantic-equivalence, no-pure-cache, and no-cross-toolchain-stability boundary fields

#### Scenario: Multi-shape HIR spike support remains fixture bounded

- GIVEN rustc-backed HIR spike evidence exists for multiple checked-in fixture shapes
- WHEN contract metadata or operator documentation describes HIR supplement support
- THEN it names the support as selected-fixture-backed and toolchain-scoped rather than general HIR support
- AND THIR, MIR, arbitrary HIR inputs, and unimplemented fixture shapes remain planned or unsupported until their own deterministic positive and negative evidence exists
